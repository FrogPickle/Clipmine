{"text": " you you you you good afternoon welcome to RSBN live I'm Robert McNeely as President Trump will give an AI summit remark in the next hour so it's five o'clock somewhere in one hour exactly on the East Coast thank you for joining us with a big news day before us if you caught any of the great coverage earlier you saw that Caroline Levitt invited DNI chief Tulsi Gabbard to detail all of the intelligence and declassifying of the facts that we know that Barack Hussein Obama the auto pen James Comey Mr. Clapper among other officials including Andrew McCabe all in this web of lies this seemingly treasonous action in order with crooked Hillary Clinton to attempt to take down and usurp the authority of the incoming and current president of the United States Donald Trump the Russia Russia Russia hoax the steel dossier crossfire hurricane as it was known and this is a scandal that truly really makes Watergate look like child's play and from the experts we've had on on the show to break all of this down all roads seem to Lee go back to Barack Hussein Obama it's a remarkable thing to look at all of this to digest it and we will replay that video for you later in the broadcast in case you missed DNI chief Tulsi Gabbard her testimony today before reporters in the James S Brady briefing room of the White House but to dive into this artificial intelligence we'll have some experts on momentarily to talk about all of this we have the vice president of the United States JD Vance who earlier this year traveled to Paris France to deal with the emerging technologies known as artificial intelligence how to harness that and how to make it work for an America first agenda which is changing the size and scope of diplomacy and our economy here at home we have President Trump just last week going to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania at the behest and invitation of Senator Dave McCormick with business leaders in the room labor leaders in the room as well as a bipartisan group of Republican and Democrat lawmakers in the Keystone State to focus on energy infrastructure drill baby drill electric also the AI infrastructure that will help save and secure the United States of America both at home and abroad we are now joined by Mark Beal the president of government affairs for AI policy network and former Pentagon AI policy director mark thank you for joining RSBN's live desk let's walk through artificial intelligence we have grok for we have situations where people like Elon Musk saying this is the most exciting technology but also the most frightful thing I've seen and we know how Elon has contributed to all of this artificial intelligence how can the United States get ahead of this so that we can dominate on a world scale yeah hey thanks for having me this administration put out a document today I that I think is going to set the agenda for the next four years and it you know it's it's only been out for a couple hours now and in our initial read it seems very promising it you know of course identifies AI as that will be a transformative and potentially decisive technology for the future of the world for our for our country and for our role in shaping the sort of course of human history here and and and I think the administration has identified all of the most important like kind of key efforts that it needs to undertake in order for us to be successful it's very clear to me that whoever was behind this document writing this they knew what they were doing and there's a lot of meat and goodness in here and and by the way it's not just all utopian happiness and you know there's also a very sober assessment that look AI could as it presents all these amazing opportunities it could propose a series of threats a threats to jobs threats to national security and it's a taking a very fair and balanced view in terms of trying to get the government's head around all that you know I find it very interesting because Pope Leo the 14th even the name he took someone followed Pope Leo the 13th and what was happening in the late 1800s with all of the industrial technologies and the emerging working technologies talking about the dignity of work but also what it might take away from those who are relying on good paying jobs so what are some of the opportunities you see mark and what are some of the negatives when it comes to the job market in the United States I mean in the near term it's it's quite clear that AI will offer enormous productivity benefits to the folks who who adopted and to use it you know as the as the kids call it chagipity my you know my I let my 16 year old use it and you know whether it's about his exercise routines and just augmenting his education you know having sort of another voice when it comes to health care although you know you can't necessarily always trust it but it can certainly give you another kind of perspective on some key issues even just yesterday I used it to order and replace my washer my wash machine and dryer that had broke so in terms of everyday life there's some there's some really great use cases unfortunately though on the dark side you know there was a Harvard business study that Harvard Business Review study that looked at the kind of three main uses use cases today they seem to be used for therapy for sex and for companionship and so I think there's where the questions around guardrails we need to start thinking heavily about so I think that's going to enter into a place in which AI may be starting to use inappropriately and when you see be cautious about some of that stuff too right and it's only you know pops up right on your phone as you're scrolling really any content whether it be on social media just two examples today one of the very positive things as we are scheduling different great interviews including your self-mark email shared with me that oh this is exactly what you're doing in the time frame so that works out very nicely as you're going through multiple emails the other side of it some rather disturbing and disgusting AI images that said hey do you want to schedule a meeting with this AI bot regarding what you just mentioned I said no thank you I'd like to go on and exit out of that but for young minds especially it might be very disturbing and it might lead people down a path that can lead to addiction lead to confusion also the fact that just like in the legacy media trying to get that information out there there are insidious actors throughout the world who would like to confuse people including the Chinese Communist Party yeah that's exactly right and we have to be extra cautious with our young minds especially especially children who may be vulnerable who may have mental health issues there's already been examples of AI bots encouraging children to actually commit suicide and so parents need to be extra attentive to their children and watching how it is that they can use this technology because at the end of the day and what this White House document I think very clearly highlights is that the AI developers they may understand how this stuff works at a big picture level but the details of how it works and why it works way that it does no one really understands it it's almost like more alchemy than it is science and that's why this White House is helping assure American leadership by investing in a field of AI science called interpretability and control these are the types of investments that's gonna help scientists unpack these models figure out exactly how they work and imply safeguards so that children can't be exploited and harmed and Mark given your background at the Pentagon what does this mean for national security and how does this change the face of warfare we were there for the flag day big beautiful parade that took place and we saw some of those dogs or even human lists tanks that can go in and actually take care of the mission but does this mean that we're in a more dangerous world now as a result of the weapons that can be produced by AI technology yeah you know it's a great question AI in some respects is like the ultimate what we call dual use technology so all of these amazing innovations that can be done with AI for good can there's almost like a dark corollary for them as well so imagine if you're thinking about trying to use AI to cure cancer or develop some novel medical cure for some you know nasty disease well that same type of underlying know-how can be applied in a malicious and malevolent way and be used to create bio weapons you know if you have a great AI that can help with you you know write amazing software and product and innovate and sell and do things on the internet well that same capability can be used to design very sophisticated malware and cyber weapons and so it's gonna be it's a tough balance between how you think about this as a commercial technology versus a military one I we are watching this technology being fielded right now in the war between Russia and Ukraine and I just see we seeing like very cheap AI enabled hardware platforms destroying very expensive capital assets for example you know a thousand dollar unmanned boat destroying a 250 million dollar Russian you know battleship and this is definitely gonna profoundly affect the nature or the character of warfare in ways that I think we're only now starting to appreciate and we have definitely seen that in the stalemate that is Russia and Ukraine one of that scary technologies being those drones that can literally just shoot fire from yards and yards away and literally burn a soldier or just burn an area even civilians as well so we pray for the end of that tragedy but here at home mark how can parents be prepared for this to protect their children against any malware or anything that might come into the home because you know we lock our doors we build walls we build fences but now it's all coming in through these things amongst other technologies so how can parents really harness that awareness to protect their young children yeah that's a great question so at the end of the day AI like electricity or what scientists call a general purpose technology and so while it is that not everybody needs to become an electrical engineer everyone needs to know not to stick the proverbial fork in the electrical socket and that's it that's a kind of a good way of thinking about AI so for example now that we know AI can do things like voice cloning and I think even the Secretary of State of Marco Rubio fell victim of this a few weeks ago you know we don't want grandma to fall victim to a scammer who's like cloning the voice of their grandson saying the grandsons in jail and that they need money wired immediately and so I think the first and most important thing we can do for our families is basic levels of education to understand what the capabilities can do and then basic kind of like proven and practical things you can do to protect yourself like like code words you know if you get a phone call from a family member that sounds just like little Johnny you need to validate that that's little Johnny's actual identity another thing you might want to think about is you know whereas in the past cyber attackers would look sort of spam you like the Nigerian princes or whatever and it was very clear like you would read that and say well that that's probably not you know somebody really trying to talk to me well with AI that that the sophistication and the scale of those types of attacks are increasing so we just have to be vigilant we have to monitor and we just have to be cautious about who we trust and making sure we're validating the sources before we take any action that could compromise our security. Yes and not to make light of it Mark but sometimes I like to joke around make sure you watch a Will Smith movie or even Terminator for Skynet because it seems as if it's silly but some of these technologies we now have even if you go back to back to the future some of those things that were talked about in there those same themes we now have some of those technologies right here in 2025 so it's amazing for some of us in our lifetimes how quickly this technology has increased and grown for the better and for the worse but we'd love to have you go on again right side broadcasting networks live desk Mark Beal president of the government AI policy network and a former Pentagon AI policy director thank you for your expertise today. Thanks for having me have a great day. You as well Mark as we are covering all the breaking news here at the live desk so much happening with the DNI intelligence speaking of that chief director Tulsi Gabbard a former Democrat turned independent then becoming a Republican during the campaign with very damning evidence now and prove that the Obama administration truly seems to be behind crossfire hurricane and the Russia hoax and also everything that's come out against this president to usurp his authority astounding it makes Watergate look like child's play and before we get to that recap video I'd like to tell you about all family pharmacy.com slash RSBN you know the new COVID variant is out and with all the storms in life literally speaking and figuratively we saw what happened to our dear friends in Texas with the Guadalupe River it's always smart to be prepared when it comes to your medicine cabinet Ivermectin hydrochloroquine NAD plus Mbendazol among 200 essential medications that are life-saving and can deal with bacterial and viral infections that might be out there because we know President Trump signing the executive order to bring down the cost of pharmaceuticals for you here in America and there are PBMs that exist it's these insurance companies and individuals and corporate entities that then own the pharmacies talk about double dipping they want to keep this life-saving medication out of your hands so right now RSBN 10 is your code RSBN 1-0 for 10 percent off your order again Ivermectin hydrochloroquine NAD plus Mbendazol among 200 essential medications including emergency medical kits and

Pritzker of all people seems to agree with President Trump on this signing legislation in Illinois to target the PBMs against those who would drive up and spike the cost of pharmaceuticals all family pharmacy comm slash RSBN you're go to with the deal RSBN 1-0 now for 10 percent off of life-saving medication be sure to visit today do not delay and be prepared here in 2025 as we cover the latest from the Trump White House at the top of the hour President Trump to address this artificial intelligence summit now the big breaking news today Tulsi Gabbard the DNI chief addressing the White House press briefing today at the behest and invitation of Caroline Levitt the goat of all press secretaries that's the greatest of all time and this 10 or so minute video detailing Tulsi Gabbard's findings for your viewing pleasure please enjoy now I'm going to go over the key findings from the House intelligence report which investigated the claims that were made by an intelligence community assessment ordered by President Obama and published in January of 2017 first Putin's principal interests relating to the 2016 election were to undermine faith in the U.S. Democratic process not show any preference of a certain candidate in fact this report shows Putin held back leaking held back from leaking compromising material on Hillary Clinton prior to the election instead planning to release it after the election to weaken what Moscow viewed as an inevitable Clinton presidency in the January 2017 intelligence community assessment that President Obama ordered John Brennan whose CIA director at the time and the intelligence community intentionally suppressed intelligence that showed Putin was saving the most damaging material that he had in his possession about Hillary Clinton until after her potential and likely victory the report goes into great detail about the information that Russia and Putin had which include on Hillary Clinton which included possible criminal acts like secret meetings with multiple named U.S. religious organizations in which State Department officials offered in exchange for supporting Secretary Clinton's campaign for the presidency significant increases in financing from the State Department they also had documents that showed the patronage of the State Department to State Department employees who would go and support Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign there were high-level DNC emails that detailed evidence of Hillary's quote psycho emotional problems uncontrolled fits of anger aggression and cheerfulness and that then secretary Clinton was allegedly on a daily regimen of heavy tranquilizers then CIA director Brennan and the intelligence community mischaracterized intelligence and relied on dubious substandard sources to create a contrived false narrative that Putin developed a quote-unquote clear preference for Trump Brennan and the IC misled lawmakers by referencing the debunked steel dossier to assess quote unquote Russia's plans and intentions falsely suggesting that this dossier had intelligence value when he knew that it was discredited the intelligence community excluded significant intelligence and ignored or selectively quoted reliable intelligence that contradicted the intelligence community assessments key findings on Putin's alleged support for Trump including this intelligence reporting would have exposed the ICA's claim as implausible if not ridiculous the intelligence community assessment omitted reliably sourced information such as how some Russian intelligence officials were quote-unquote planning for candidate Hillary Clinton's victory while others assess neither Trump nor Clinton would respect Russia's interests as was reflected in the ODNI documents that we released on Friday multiple intelligence community assessments released in the months leading up to the November 2016 election concluded that Russia had neither the intent nor capability to impact the outcome of the US election on December 5th of 2016 the FBI and ODNI gave the House Intelligence Committee its first post-election classified briefing in which there was no mention of Putin aspiring to elect Trump by either agency the presidential daily brief drafted on December 8th of 2016 stated that no Russian or criminal actors impacted vote counts this document was pulled just hours before it was to be published due to quote-unquote new guidance if it had been published it would have been briefed to both President Obama and President-elect Donald Trump on December 9th 2016 a national security council meeting was called to gather President Obama's senior national security officials which included CIA director Brennan then Obama DNI James Clapper Susan Rice and others following that secret meeting DNI Clapper's assistant sent an email to the intelligence community with the subject line POTUS tasking on Russia election meddling tasking ODNI leaders to create a new assessment per the president's request the House Intelligence Committee oversight report that we released today reveals that quote unlike routine intelligence community analysis the intelligence community assessment was a high-profile product ordered by the president President Obama it directed senior intelligence community agency heads and created an intelligence community assessment limited to just five analysts using one principal drafter this is not something that occurs in the normal path of producing an intelligence community assessment that reflects the views across the intelligence community the production of this intelligence community assessment was subject to unusual directives directly from the president and senior political appointees especially the former director of the CIA John Brennan the House Intelligence Committee oversight report also shows how later that same day on December 9th Brennan ordered the publication of quote-unquote substandard reporting on Russian activities which had previously been withheld from publication of prior assessments because the information was judged quote to have not met long-standing publication standards some of the information later used in the Obama ordered assessment over the objections of veteran CIA officers was quote-unquote unclear or from unknown sources the intelligence committee's oversight report reveals that CIA director Brennan overruled senior CIA officers who challenged the Obama ordered intelligence assessment stating quote we don't have direct information that Putin wanted to get Trump elected yet the Obama directed assessment was published on January 6 2017 which explicitly stated quote we assess Putin and the Russian government aspired to help president elect Trump's election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him end of quote the CIA and FBI then led by John Brennan and James Comey expressed high confidence in this judgment while the NSA expressed moderate confidence yet as the report we released today shows the ICA the intelligence community assessment did not cite any report where Putin indicated helping Trump win was an objective the opposite is true with regards to the steel dossier we now know that one of the source documents that the Obama administration used in the creation of this intelligence assessment in January of 2017 was none other than the discredited unverified steel dossier the House Intel report states quote contradicting public claims by then CIA director Brennan that the dossier was not in any way incorporated into this intelligence assessment the dossier was referenced in the intelligence assessments main body text and further detailed in a two page assessment annex John Brennan lied and he denied using this dossier in this intelligence assessment that president Obama ordered because he knew it was discredited it was a politically motivated manufactured document he directed senior CIA officials to use it anyway CIA officer told the House Intelligence Committee staff as they investigated this quote the director of the CIA John Brennan refused to remove it and when confronted with the dossiers many flaws responded quote yes but doesn't it ring true even the bipartisan committee on intelligence report published in 2020 criticized the FBI's handling of the steel dossier noting it's completely unverified nature and purposeful sidestepping of intelligence community procedures in its use now president Obama Hillary Clinton John Brennan James Clapper James Comey and others including their mouthpieces in the media knowingly lied as they repeated the contrived narrative that was created in this January 2017 intelligence community assessment with high confidence as though it were fact John Brennan as CIA director stated in a memo to his agency staff in December of 2016 saying quote there is strong consensus among us on the scope nature and intent of Russian interference in our presidential elected election this was reported by NBC News confirming that Brennan along with James Clapper and James Comey agreed with the CIA's assessment that Russia intervened to help Trump win the presidency as Obama's director of national intelligence James Clapper was tasked with overseeing the creation of this assessment in January of 2017 by President Obama and he expressed confidence in its findings in a 2018 interview with the Harvard Gazette he talked about how he provided Trump with the same classified assessment that President Obama received which included the high confidence judgment that Putin directly ordered the hacking and election interference Clapper then went on to add I think they the Russians actually influenced the outcome this is a brief summary of the details that you'll find within the House majority staffs report in their investigation into the Obama directed January 2017 intelligence community assessment that leads us to the very same conclusion that we announced in the release of our documents on Friday the implications of this are far-reaching and have to do with the integrity of our Democratic Republic it has to do with an outgoing president taking action to manufacture intelligence to undermine and usurp the will of the American people in that election and launch what would be a years-long coup against the incoming president United States Donald Trump truly an incredible thing to witness and watch this afternoon and please we have had a full day of news here at right-side broadcasting network go back to the streams this morning whether it's CPAC hosting that convention that conference in Washington DC on stopping human trafficking at the number of elected officials including attorneys general one just next door in Georgia Chris Carr also a candidate for governor of Georgia his office working very hard to stop that as well as different private groups and public institutions secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Christy Noam launching that opening remarks this morning along with Matt and Mercedes Schlapp about modern slavery and what has taken place over the course of the last several years and well into the auto pen and the Obama administrations and the fact that they did not touch these things in order to save those who are perpetrated and ultimately worked and sex traffic so for example 300,000 kids plus loss under the auto pen administration president Trump has stated recently that 10,000 have been recovered and brought back into society but that please go back in that stream and watch that when you can just to get all of the in-depth information it's really disturbing as we go on day-to-day now hour-by-hour as it seems Barack Hussein Obama and the auto pen really left this country vulnerable on a number of different issues from an open border to a fentanyl crisis to human trafficking to a bloated economy to bureaucrats who really ran the show instead of the elected officials you put into place and what you just heard there from DNI chief Tulsi Gabbard that his administration Barack Hussein Obama behind this crossfire hurricane Russia Russia Russia steel dossier hoax and now breaking news actually out from NBC that a judge denies the Department of Justice request to unseal Jeffrey Epstein grand jury transcripts and that the ruling was separate from a request in the Justice Department has pending related to a grand jury ruling in the southern district of New York where Epstein ultimately was indicted why am I giving you this 30,000-foot view right now because even last night it's so important in the media to get the truth out there as soon as possible because once a story hits the cycle people are busy they have jobs they have to take care of their children and they might not get the entire story I had a friend in Bible study last night I can't tell you his political opinions on a plethora of things prop up probably a more traditionally conservative person stating that almost in a joke and a grumbling oh our government's doing things that are important like getting rid of high fructose corn syrup which is extremely important the Maha agenda that Secretary Kennedy is looking over at this very minute but he said they're trying to hide the Epstein files nothing could be further from the truth because you have Attorney General Pam Bondi at the directive of DOJ instructed by President Trump to release all credible information as soon as possible relating to those files and relating to trafficking and there you have the Attorney General seeking that in court but certain judges sealing that we will stay on all these stories and bring you the most up-to-date information because we believe you the American people can make up your minds for yourselves right left and center everywhere in between up and down to get the truth out there that's what's so exciting about the new media conservative media whatever you'd like to call it the non-corporate media to get you the truth because we know that you're smarter than those who want to control your lives that you know how to run your finances you know how to run your household and we know that most people are good in this fair country of ours as we await President Trump to speak on artificial intelligence at a summit at the top of the hour now we are joined by Brendan Steinhauser of the Alliance for Secure CEO this is for Secure AI he is the chief executive officer also the Steinhauser strategies partner group thank you Brendan for joining us to dive into artificial intelligence we had Warren Buffett on Saturday stating how exciting this is but how scary the AI idea is because it can make decisions for itself it can run a number of different things that might change our society what say you as an expert in the artificial intelligence realm yeah it really is sort of like a number of other tools it can be a tool for good it can be a tool that's neutral or for bad and so I think that while AI offers a lot of promises it offers a lot of potential cures for diseases untold wealth can that can be created advances in technology and science and mathematics it could also if misused or if we cannot align it to human values it could lead to catastrophic outcomes for humanity so it's really a double-edged sword and it's something we have to lead on as United States we have to dominate in the Intel artificial intelligence marketplace commercially but we have to be very careful that we don't create something that ends up being a catastrophe for all of humanity Brendan how do you align it to that somehow rational human thinking we've seen some of this technology happening with self-driving cars with what Elon Musk has worked on at Tesla or even Google as especially on the West Coast I'm sure people have seen those cars that go around and take the video and photo footage for you so you can have Google Maps among other technologies but what comes to mind for me as someone who's somewhat green on this I'm somewhat of a novice on artificial intelligence I start to think I robot where it's well-intentioned and then all the sudden the robot the artificial intelligence starts thinking for itself and to protect the humans it then starts eliminating the humans to protect them from themselves so how do you counter what could be a very dark age when it comes to these advancements and technologies yeah it's a great question it's one of the most important questions that humanity has faced since our since the dawn of civilization it's the most important question we will face in the next couple of years because many people believe that we're entering this new phase of artificial general intelligence or even a super intelligence in the next two to three years you're gonna hear more and more about these things in the next few months and in the next year or two and so it's rapidly advancing so the way that you prevent that that nightmarish scenario is through solving the alignment problem which is a very difficult problem that industry leaders and outside experts say we have not solved and very few people are actually optimistic that we can solve the alignment problem to guarantee that AI is controlled by humans to guarantee that it's aligned with our values and that we always have control over it AI is something that is not programmed to do things it's something that is grown it's trained on massive amounts of data we don't fully understand how it works how it actually gets from the inputs to the outputs and so it is it's by definition kind of frightening and so until we unless and until we solve the alignment problem there could be a nightmare scenario like iRobot and it's funny because a lot of people do bring up science fiction movies and novels and you know I would actually say that's that's one that kind of hits the closest to home when you look at what Tesla is developing with Optimus and it's going to be powered by Grock I mean we are we are seeing the advancement of robotics along with AI and so there are some real concerns about that and I think you know whether or not AI decides to eliminate human beings you know it may or may not do that that's a real scenario that could happen but I think it's as like they're even more likely that AI ends up trying to control humanity tries to take take over control at first subtly at first in a very incremental way but then at some day we wake up and we realize that we've either ceded control or we've lost control to AI that's the scenario that I think keeps experts at night and specifically into that topic with the science fiction movies I think of Skynet as well for with Terminator is that more from a willingness of Americans let's say out of convenience for example you can order the Uber to go get you some fast food instead of either making it yourself or just getting up into your car from your home your apartment to go grab that yourself through the fast food line is it really a willingness for comfort that would lead to that or is it something that we're putting all these things well-intentioned into place and then the artificial intelligence just getting rapidly ahead of even what we saw in the first place yeah it's a great question I think my fear is that it's both we are ceding control volitionally we're basically giving control to more and more computer systems to AI in particular at the same time it's getting smarter and smarter and faster and faster and so we're probably just a couple of years away from AGI artificial general intelligence where it can plan and plot and execute plans not only things that we're telling it to do but it can figure out the best way that it wants to pursue its own interest and so it's going to be so much smarter than us at some point and again nobody knows for sure but many experts in fact most experts are saying it's going to be here within two to three years it's moving so fast so rapidly it's going to get to a point where it's thinking so much faster than us and it's in a way where we can't even keep up with the speed at which it's thinking and it's almost like you know you could almost expect it to go down a path that we're not expecting right the path that is least expected in order to take control and again I know this does sound like science fiction but a lot of us are saying what was science fiction 10 or 20 or 30 years ago is actually becoming science when you look at what's happening in the labs and one of the labs Anthropic has been releasing some of its reports some of the testing that it's doing of all the different models not only at Anthropic but other models they're actually showing where AIs that are you know for all considerations today not that smart compared to where they're going to be tomorrow they're already doing things like blackmailing lying deceiving threatening human beings and these kind of test scenarios and so it's really scary when you think about okay this is just sort of baby AI what happens when we have AI very soon that is a PhD and literally every subject known to man and there seems to be some hope as well even with the dark realities that come with this technology we have Vice President JD Vance just several months ago visiting Paris France in this AI summit and speaking to the benefits of what can be on the horizon while being aware of those technologies that might advance slightly too quickly what do you anticipate today from President Trump's comments to come roughly in 20 minutes at this AI summit I think the president is going to obviously talk about his AI action plan which I have read and honestly looks really good overall in terms of you know the United States leading in AI development he talks in the plan about protecting our critical infrastructure from adversaries making sure that we're using AI to protect ourselves from cyber attacks I think we need to develop offensive capabilities as well I think I expect him to talk about innovation and leadership but I also hope that he talks about things like preventing our adversaries from developing advanced AI preventing China in particular from getting access to these really powerful semiconductor chips which by the way most of those are manufactured in Taiwan which China has its sights set on and so I hope to see the president talk about that one thing we need to do is make sure that we're not allowing China to get these powerful chips like the age 20s that Nvidia is now able to sell to China so we need to reverse that policy I hope the president goes in that direction but I think you're going to hear him talk a lot about American leadership and about preventing our adversaries from obtaining powerful systems because I think he does understand and does you know does get the fact that if our adversaries have this technology if they beat us to something that that is far more powerful than we have today we could be in a real real sticky situation huge foreign policy implications and perhaps that will be something he discusses with Premier Xi Jinping when he travels to China that date forthcoming from the White House scheduler but what else can we see here Brendan when it comes to government regulation over this do you see it being more of a government run situation with artificial intelligence or will private business really open the way as we've seen from Tesla to Google to countless other companies working on all of these technologies yeah I would really like to see the frontier labs so that's open ai google deep mind xai and anthropic I would like to see them do safety and security measures on their own things that they should do to protect their own intellectual property to prevent it from getting into the hands of the Chinese Communist Party for example there's a lot that they can do just using their own security they need to beef up information security physical security they need to have different fail safes in place so that if one security measure fails there's others other layers of protection beyond that they need to beef up their research on alignment this problem I talked about earlier to make sure that ai is aligned with human values we're underfunding that as an industry we need to see more of that they need to bring in outside experts to test these models to evaluate these models I think there's a lot that the private sector can do to lead and to develop this technology in a safe and secure way and I I frankly think it's in their own interest to do that because if they do develop something that's extremely dangerous if they if there are any indications that this we could lose control over these systems then I think that's exactly when the federal government is going to step in and take it over and some people are advocating for that a sort of Manhattan project type approach others are really worried about that I have personal concerns about you know big tech and big government getting together and using artificial intelligence to collect lots of data to do massive surveillance on American citizens and do something that could really take away our liberty so I really hope and pray that the the the leaders in big tech do the right thing I think it's in their self-interest I think it's in the interest of all of humanity frankly that they do that but you know there's always got to be that that backup plan I think the backup plan is smart narrow targeted regulation and we've seen some of that in the last 20 or so years whether it be the Patriot Act for example or even what happened to President Trump being thrown off of then Twitter then Facebook but now some of those CEOs in the tech world seem to want to play ball and that's a good thing because it's a win-win for free speech before we part ways Brendan how do you see this affecting I guess the dignity of work because and as a result of all these technologies just like the turn of the century going from the 1800s to the 1900s some jobs eliminated as a result thanks to these advancements in technologies yeah there there are a lot of CEOs of big companies in this country who are sounding the alarm about this and saying we could be facing unemployment rates of 10 percent or 12 percent or maybe even 20 percent in the next few years and that would be a huge huge problem for the United States if we are not able to transition you know do this AI transition in a way that's good for workers if we don't put American workers first not only is that bad for workers that's bad for our economy it creates more social inequality it allows more concentration of power and wealth and big tech you could have things like riots in the streets and political and economic instability that could be really dangerous politically and economically so I do worry about that and I think that one thing president or JD JD Vance vice president Vance said in Paris was we need to put American workers first and I think the president has that in his plan and he'll say that probably here in a few minutes as well I think that's really critical we have to take care of American workers AI has to be a tool that augments American workers that supports us that creates wealth and makes sure that the wealth is not concentrated in the hands of the few and so I think there's we need some really good ideas on that we need some smart public policy on that and I hope that we'll hear that from the president today and from his team going forward and I think that we will as an expert on this do you foresee any troubles if let's just say hypothetically we know there's legislation being discussed and out there against us but a central bank digital currency if that were to get into the hands of AI could that cause problems I just see something down the road like mass inflation to mass starvation as a result of people not even able to acquire assets yeah that's a very scary proposition I think that's something that a lot of people are talking more about and I think it goes back to that basic principle of you know seaving control to these systems to AI I think that can be very dangerous I was talking to a retired Air Force Colonel about this the other day and he was involved in a bit of the command and control related to nuclear weapons and we were talking about the the danger of seething control over nuclear weapons and that that is being discussed in some circles seething that control to AI now that would be a very frightening proposition so whether it's finance or it's the military I think we have to be very careful as we as we go forward in this kind of brave new world of advanced AI.

today so he did not have to travel far for this great presentation and uh thanks to the expertise of the gentleman we had on today regarding artificial intelligence from public policy to private entities making this all happen uh so much on the forefront for us whether it is the grok for these uh robots that are being produced by tesla to help you around the house i don't know if i want one because it would kind of freak me out if they came walking in in the middle of the night trying to fix whatever it was i think i'd rather just do it myself but there are some exciting things about what's on the forefront with all of these technologies and president trump on the heels as well brilliant new trade deals with the philippines with indonesia with japan and in a rapid rate really over the course of a 24 hour period house speaker mike johnson having an impromptu press conference today in the halls of congress stating that he was with president trump last night for the famous 550 billion dollar deal being totaled by the japanese government and house speaker on hand in the oval office last night to witness that stating mike johnson saying that when i write the book one day it might be art of the deal perhaps 2.0 because it was a master class in what president trump does best so this opens japanese markets and president trump stating such on true social over the course of the last 24 hours that the japanese markets now open to the united states and that they will have us goods available to them and these tariff rates bringing in approximately 550 billion dollars remember japan is for the first time ever opening its market to the united states of america even to cars suv's trucks and everything else even agriculture and rice which was always a complete no no no the open market japan may be as big a profit factor as the tariffs themselves but was only gotten because of the tariff power they also agreed to buy billions of dollars worth of military and other equipment and give us 90 percent of 550 billion dollars and more maga that is president trump earlier today on truth social just this morning regarding that outstanding deal now with indonesia and the philippines in those specific deals both countries have to pay a 90 percent upfront surcharge in tariffs to do business with the united states in turn the united states does not have any tariff to give in a reciprocal fashion as you see there too posted by the white house and at real donald trump biggest day of trade of all time japan opening the markets the united states and paying reciprocal tariffs of 15 percent indonesia eliminating 99 percent of tariff barriers for united states products and the philippines opening markets with the united states and zero tariffs on our end that is a brilliant move and a great success for really a a citizenry of outstanding people all three cultures just fantastic big fans of the united states when it comes to everything from the pop culture to the sports to the music and in our churches as well a shared faith with many of those great nations i think especially of the philippino population it's very true you will see in each and every catholic church a large philippino population and such an interesting wonderful group of people so seemingly far away from the world but their president mentioning or around the world their president mentioning yesterday the world is becoming a smaller place with all of these technologies i'm sure we'll hear from president trump with the ai race against the chinese communist party the influence that the chinese want over that region and that's why it's so important watch on a daily basis the building blocks of this administration putting together a winning coalition securing our border reinvesting in the world economy changing the world economy through tariffs and through lifting of trade barriers but also through great new deals that will benefit american manufacturing and big beautiful blue collar jobs and this all crucial because it all turns to a communist party the new soviet union the chinese government wants total and complete dominance and i'm sure the last six months have not been easy for them now with the japanese thailand also philippino trade deals taking place that's on the heels of a trade deal with vietnam and president trump dominating not only in european markets and the renegotiated deals with nato for five percent gdp with all member nations except for spain president trump saying that spain will pay it one way or another most likely through another trade deal but now in the indoe pacific and that has a direct effect effect on the chinese communist party and their mission to dominate all different kinds of markets they were able to just a few years ago and they had four years to really do that under the autopen now things have completely changed and it's very important probably president trump touching on this today that the semi-conductors that are produced in taiwan that country must be protected because we know that the communist party wants to move in and dominate that island a free people who deserve to be free who in fact will wave american flags in the streets along with their the taiwan flag because they believe in freedom and we're called to be those kind of americans that the world sees us as a beacon of hope a beacon of inspiration nearly 250 years young as we are five minutes away from the scheduled remarks of president donald john trump winning the ai race that's the theme of this summit it's five o'clock somewhere and it's five minutes to that five o'clock hour on the east coast in washington dc now countless other successes coming across the channels today as president trump and the white house outlining what they are saying regarding the united states and indonesia trade deal another win for america first president trump's landmark reciprocal trade agreement with indonesia is another critical step forward in the trump administration's relentless pursuit of america first policies with tariffs with trade deals and things that put america first finally unlike the living predecessors of donald trump who decided to bankrupt detroit but rather bankroll beijing the deal eliminates 99 percent of tariff barriers for a full range of united states industrial food and agricultural exports and that unlocks new market access and breaks down non-tariff barriers for american workers families and manufacturers now in addition to all of that happening there is secure unprecedented access for the united states and japan strategic trading and investment opportunities this historic trade deal and investment between the united states and japan just yesterday evening is a landmark economic agreement with the japanese government one of america's closest allies and most important trading partners the historic deal reflects the strength of the united states and japan's relationship and japan's recognition of the united states as the most attractive and secure destination for strategic development in the entire world including many investments now the agreement reaffirms the shared commitment of both nations to economic prosperity industrial leadership and long-term security it delivers a powerful signal that the united states and japan alliance is not only a cornerstone of peace in the indopacific but also a driver of global growth and innovation with over 550 billion in a new japanese and united states investment vehicle and enhanced access for american exports the agreement marks a new chapter in bilateral cooperation between the two great nations one that will unleash the full potential of the united states economy for american workers communities and businesses for decades to come now restoring the american industrial power japan will invest 550 billion directly into the united states economy as a result as we think our sponsors here on rsbn's

soon you will see your 45th and 47th commander in chief president trump to speak at this ai summit and we have exclusive footage now of president trump leaving the white house you you you you you you so all of this success with ai with securing a border with a great economy with inflation coming down as president trump leaves the white house just moments ago in route to this ai summit focused on winning the ai race the white house explaining that small business sentiment surges as the one big beautiful bill takes effect small business owners are matching the market with increased confidence in recent cnbc reports which show that a renewed sense of economic optimism coming from this white house and this administration with landmark policies such as the one big beautiful bill that was signed into law on the 4th of july now president trump makes gains on the economy and policy with small business owners including labor union owners and members even among democrats now here's what you need to know nearly half of small business owners rate the economy as excellent or good up from 30 in previous quarters now more than half of small business owners expect revenue to increase over the next year up 10 from last year and more describe their business conditions as good and this is nearly 370 days from the auto pen dropping out of the presidential race from the oval office surrounded by his crime family including laptop hunter who has said recently that the cocaine that was left to the white house wasn't his but i'll i'll ask the white house staff if they knew what was happening there seems like they left some crumbs of truth behind in their flurry and plethora of lies and thank god that we have someone white house press secretary the goat caroline levitt setting the record straight today with dni chief tulsi gabard because we remember koreen john pierre who really struggled and has in fact left the democrat party because she said that she did not was instructed not to tell the truth under the auto pen but so many remarkable things happening over the course of a year and thanks be to god for you the american people that put this constitutional government back into place to save the country now fewer small business owners have been or expect to be impacted by tariffs directly in fact it's been found that tariffs are not causing a spike in inflation in fact inflation going down and gas prices the lowest since july of 2021 so most of you the good american people hitting the road rather be by plane train or automobile to celebrate the fourth of july and also to celebrate those family reunions those fishing trips and those get-togethers that are so crucial to just the joy and the beauty of life i love getting out there out into the great outdoors and i hope you do as well perhaps also planning a great trip to washington dc to see great places like where president trump is speaking from this evening but also the museums and the history that have been the landmark of this great nation for nearly 250 years there has been a sharp decline in the number of small business owners who expect government regulations tax policy and trade policy to negatively impact their procedures and operations there is clear confidence in president trump and the spike that we've seen nearly six in ten small business owners approving of his job performance i'm actually surprised it's not nine out of ten or ten out of ten at this point with survey monkeys sam gutieras stating that small business owners who identify as democrats report the largest increase in that sentiment they are much more optimistic about business conditions compared to last quarter so all delivered to you by this president this administration subject matter experts committed to your safety not only securing the southern border fighting human trafficking but building an economy that works for you in 2025 especially with the questions of what's before us with grok for artificial intelligence these robots these self-driving cars all good things but in the same breath and same scope as we analyze this what does it mean for the future of humanity we had two experts on in the last hour speaking to just that the idea that ai can actually turn against us that it could start thinking for itself and how do we harness that as a good and moral people from the private sector and from the public sector and ultimately as the space race happened during the 1960s between the united states and the soviet union who will win this ai race will it be the chinese communist party who has proven they have no moral authority they have no conscience as they have literally taken people by train weger muslims in fact to concentration camps and hard labor camps our satellites have image and footage of that it's not hyperbole it's fact they are practicing terrible things including keeping people in buildings where they're literally living on top of one another including very strict covid mandates that still exist in the chinese communist country it's a very sad fact and reality as they seem to have no moral obligation to serve their fellow man we do here as a constitutional republic in believing that it is one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all as dhs secretary christy noah put it so eloquently today at the cpac summit fighting human trafficking that this modern slavery must come to an end as president abraham lincoln so eloquently stated during his tenure in the white house about having that moral clarity and the recognition on that evil practice that once was stopped in this country it's now up to us to stop modern slavery whether it come in the form of weger muslims being shipped off on trains to concentration and hard labor camps whether it's the fentanyl crisis with the angel moms who have been on this network and countless others in the new media getting the message out there whether it was the stream yesterday where you saw the subcommittee on biden's border betrayal and senator cruz finally coming out there passionately unlike the other senators to state how evil this was and how sorry he was to people like miss vega who lost family members to the fentanyl crisis who had a deep state individual by the last name of fly shaker who was the chief of staff in the dhs during the biden auto pen administration she's remained on as the executive secretary perhaps she should lose her job just as james komie's daughter did and the department of justice last week because they have a mindset of a globalist agenda a uniparty a league of deep state shadows that want to silence you the american people and in turn because of their policies because of allowing chinese communist fentanyl to come through the southern mexican border through those cartels the ms-13 and trendea ragua now foreign terrorist organizations thanks to the strong pen and executive orders of president donald trump on day one of january 20th of this year when he came back into office they wanted those things to happen and the question is why is it because they hated america is it because they thought that everyone pouring through the border would somehow then be valid to become citizens or simply get a license so they could then go vote illegally it's a valid question why would you want to risk the sovereignty and the security of the united states already a nation that's so generous in countless ways give us your tired your meek your humble those longing and yearning to be free how many of our countless ancestors especially coming from western and eastern europe in the 1910s the 1950s and even closer to right now in 2025 my family coming over in 1906 from ireland idly norway in order

what ai might have on all of this technology and all of this to protect not only the homeland but generations to come because it's our general welfare our posterity that we must watch out for that is

history as we're 15 minutes after the top of the hour it's been a big news day in case you missed it go and scrub back not only this broadcast but to mr matthew alvarez in the morning featuring the first stream that dealt with human trafficking cpac is doing something about it and they had experts from private organizations to public entities attorneys general including a candidate for governor of georgia chris car speaking on how we keep people safe in the united states of america and sadly our country the biggest consumer of human trafficking it's i hate to say it but it's true awareness is key education is vital in order to stop this modern-day slavery and secretary christy knowham of the department of homeland security really kicking off matt and mercedes schlapps beautiful words to start off the conference and speaking to how dhs working overtime to help save lives and stop the human trafficking that was made available because of an open border thanks to the autopen and alejandro mayorkas over the course of the last four years also white house press secretary caroline levitt the greatest of all time inviting the dni chief tulsi gabber to detail now declassified information it's clear this web of lies coming from barack hussein obama the autopen james comey crooked hillary clinton the communist john brennan among others including that andrew mccabe who was trying to make money going on networks like the clinton news network and simply not telling the truth and what about senator adam schiff who was on that house committee whom devin nu\u00f1ez when he was serving on that same committee with him asking him to produce this so-called evidence of a russian collusion hoax that we know today was a hoax trying to usurp the authority and to strike at the heels of a duly elected president of the united states that being donald trump they threw lawfare at him fake impeachments wasted taxpayer dollars and now after two assassination attempts on top of that senator adam schiff of the golden state of california pencil neck himself shifty schiff as we like to call him here at the network to coin a couple of terms from from the president of the united states is likely guilty of mortgage fraud he has claimed full-time residency not only in california which he represents but on his town home in mariland amazing it must be nice to have liberal privilege we know that don jr has spoken out about that very topic in fact writing a book called liberal privilege how must how nice it must be to be a clinton or a schiff or an obama but it seems as if those orange jumpsuits are waiting right around the corner because these people for years have committed countless crimes against humanity and weaponized a justice department against political opponents i thought this was the united states of america i thought that it is truly one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all that no one is above the law and we'll see where all of it ends up leading and for those who are staying on the epstein files as you should we are here at the network just being reported by nbc news roughly an hour or so ago that a judge has blocked the department of justice's attempts under attorney general pan bondy and fbi director cash patel to get those documents unsealed so for those that are saying the trump administration is doing nothing about this look a little closer pay attention to new media and tune into your favorite live desk who's staying on and for you on a 24 seven basis because we want the truth out there as president trump will speak at this ai summit momentarily from now on the heels of three new trade deals japan indonesia and the philippines all visiting with the president either in person or over the phone and as mike johnson the speaker of the house put it what a great deal he saw in real time last night from the oval office in the west wing this president working overtime not only to win the ai race but to save western civilization as a result if you look at the building blocks of the 20 promises made promises kept it all relates to a secure border renegotiating global trade deals security packs including nato and the gene seven and now we're going to toss it now as the people stand that means president trump walking into the room to address this ai summit thank you very much everybody what a great song that is but we'll we'll cut it a little short because we have some business to discuss and what a group of smart ones we have in front of me today that's about as good as it comes up here the brain power the greatest power of them all the brain power well i'm thrilled to be here with so many tech leaders and luminaries as we take historic action to reassert the future which belongs to america always has belonged to america we just lost sight of it on occasion and i just want to start by stating that we've just concluded our big trade deal with japan and numerous other countries in addition as you know but on the japan deal because it was literally just signed letter was just signed it gives us a sort of signing bonus so i'll bring it into sports talk a signing bonus like you have signing bonuses too i understand you get a lot of money hundred hundred million that's not bad but that's not as good as the signing bonus we got we got a five hundred and fifty billion dollar signing bonus for the country and we had the tariff at 25 percent as you know we had a tariff at 25 percent and this was uh these are great people that we negotiated with but we agreed to reduce it to 15 based on the fact that japan has agreed for the first time ever to open up its country to trade so that all of our american businesses and business geniuses including many in this room can go out and do business openly and freely in japan a very rich and prosperous and profitable and wonderful country frankly and we will pay a zero tariff as we do business in japan so we're paying zero they're paying 15 we're getting 550 billion dollars and to be exact it's 90 percent of that but we control the whole lot of it and it's really been great and they're very happy and their stock market went up and our stock market went up and that's supposed to be the way it is ours went way up and theirs went up and we've made numerous other deals like that but the opening up of a country is very important to us we have numerous countries that have opened their doors just made some incredible transactions but we're going to have a very very simple tariff for some of the countries have so many countries you can't negotiate deals with everyone so i'll have a straight simple tariff of anywhere between 15 and 50 percent a couple we have 15 because we haven't been getting along with those countries too well so we just say let's pay 50 and that's the way it is but remember we get countries that were closed always closed every one in this room would never remember any of them to be open we we've offered such a deal to the european union where we're in serious negotiations and if they agree to open up the union to american businesses then we will let them pay a lower tariff so the tariff is very important but the opening of a country i think can be more important if our businesses do the job that they're supposed to be doing such openings are worthy of many points in tariffs and they're a good thing not only for as an example in japan or europe but certainly a great thing for america because it allows our businesses to go out and fairly compete and do really well if they compete properly like the people that i know every one of this room practically i know has competed very successfully i haven't seen any and i know the i know the losers just like i know the winners i tell you i don't see any of the losers here but now if some of the countries that pay 25 or more on orders complain remember that japan was willing to pay upfront the $550 billion for that privilege of negotiating with the united states of america we also made a deal yesterday with the philippines and indonesia which in both cases will be opening up their country and we're in the process of completing our deal with china and as you know the uk we've made a deal it's a very good deal for everybody everybody's happy it's always nice when everybody can be happy but mostly we'll be charging straight tariffs to most of the rest of the world because we have over 200 countries people don't realize it's a lot of that's a lot of deals even if you're like me a deal junkie that's a lot of deals that would be too much for anybody who how did we do with this country that i never heard of we got a lot of we got a lot of deals cooking but america is taking in hundreds of billions of dollars like it never has before uh investments into our country at the highest point ever in history and we've just really been opened up for business for three of the six months the first couple of months we got ourselves all set done a great job with our military as you know you saw that two weeks ago when you saw the way those incredible b2s flew into iran and took out an entire nuclear potential deadly force but i want to thank uh some of the incredible people that they see before me including white house ai zhar david sax he's been great for organizing this very important summit and especially for putting it in dc where it's a little bit easier i don't know if it's easy for you but it's a hell of a lot easier for me along with his colleagues at the all-in podcast which is very good i did that podcast a year and a half ago and i said this is something it was pretty new pretty raw everybody i knew saw that podcast i said well he's got something pretty good who is that guy he's a smart guy by the way i think if i ever get in which at the time people were saying i had a shot not as good a shot as it turned out we won in numbers and don't put the police we won every swing state we won by millions and millions of votes winning the popular vote we won with the uh districts as they would call them 2,750 to 505 and that's why the map is almost completely red except for a couple of little blue areas on each side of it but it was a great experience frankly for me and hopefully it's a great experience and been a great experience for our country because they're saying we had the greatest six months that a president has ever had the opening six months and i'm not even sure maybe six months i'm not sure it's the opening but let's go with the opening six months it sounds a little bit nicer i want to also uh say hello and thank you to math and his wonderful wife nat thank you very much for being here thank you very much it was great seeing you again great couple david friedberg and uh even as we know jason calla canis i say even thank you jason thank you jason i appreciate that yeah it's good person thanks as well to the hill and valley forum and our future under secretary of state jacob hellberg good good stand up i met him a year and a half ago and i was very impressed i said let's bring him in we're bringing a lot of smart people and david's been unbelievable as the job he's doing along with secretary's dug a bergam who's been incredible dug thank you that great job he's uh he's producing low-cost energy we're down to 64 dollars i want to get it down a little bit further if we can i don't know the oil companies love that or not but we want to have very inexpensive electricity so that you can power up the plants because you need more electricity than any human beings ever in the history of the world when i heard what you really need i said you got to be kidding double what we produce right now for everything right i don't know you're gonna jensen you're gonna have to explain that to me someday why they need so dare much could you do with a little bit less my father always used to say turn off the lights son but you guys are turning up the lights i want to thank howard lotnik for doing a terrific job he was involved in the big deal that we just completed with japan howard wherever you are howard where is howard hi howard great job you did appreciate it really i was an interesting negotiation wasn't it these are tough people these are good negotiators i will tell you japan but they love their country and they do what's right for their country i want to thank chris right if chris is around chris is here because he's helping with the tremendous energy success that we're having we're having tremendous energy success we're the biggest we have more energy than anybody else in the world nobody knew that until i came along but we have more energy than anybody else in the world we're making incredible deals on energy including deals in alaska while we sort of that's the mother lord that's the big one and we're making deals with various asian countries that need it and it's actually hard to believe you don't think of it but asia is very close to alaska relatively speaking it's not the closest but it is pretty much the closest when it comes to oil and gas and energy and we're making some incredible deals and i want to thank chris chris is fantastic works in partnership really with this gentleman who's the head of all of you've got the land and he's got the energy right but you really they formed a great partnership dug so uh that's uh one of the greatest partnerships i've seen in a long time they work hand in hand and they have done a great job administrators uh kelly lofler i think is here kelly thank you very much hi kelly thank kelly and probably the most important man in the room and i see it in all sincerity more important than dug and chris and all that energy they're producing he's a man that produces fast permits on the environmental impact statements he gets them done i said lee you have one week one week for nuclear and you have a couple of days for oil and gas okay for the approvals and we kid but you know he really is he's knocking them out fast he's knocked out a lot you a lot of you guys have started your plans already and you've already had your approvals so where's lee zelden is he here he is so great this guy he is so great that's why he has a slightly better seat than i gave to duck you see now he's doing a fantastic job in a lot of ways but he's doing a great job but he's getting fast permits and safe and good and everything else but he's moving them along rapidly already given some and you know one of the most exciting things we'll talk about in a second is the fact that you're going to build your own electric producing plants when you build whatever you're building and it could be it's different things including automobile factories which are going up all over the place you'll see them starting soon where they're moving into our country because of the tariffs because they don't want to pay the tariffs they're moving into our country at a record a record speed but the ability to build your own electric plant not having to rely on a 100 year plus old grid and then if you have electric capacity extra you're going to sell it into the grid make some money but you'll sell it right back into the grid director of the office of science and technology policy michael kratzios michael thank you very much thank you michael as well oh it's supposed to be taking a vote right now big vote senator ted cruz or senator cruz here oh look at my senator why aren't you voting i think we lost david mccormick who's voting so why aren't is david here because you're supposed to be voting ted i don't know i'll tell you why this man works hard ted works hard and he works good and a very special thanks to some of the top industry leaders here including somebody that's amazing i said look we'll break this guy up this before i learned the facts of life i said we'll break him up they said no say very hard i said why i said what percentage of the market does he have so he has 100 percent i said who the hell is he what's his name his name is jensen wong nevidia i said what the hell is nevidia i've never heard of it before he said you don't want to know about it sir i figured we could go in and we could sort of break him up a little bit get him a little competition and i found out it's not easy in that business i said supposedly we put the greatest minds together they work hand in hand for a couple of years he said no it would take at least 10 years to catch him if he ran nevidia totally incompetently from now on so i said all right let's go on to the next one and then i got to know jensen and now i see why jensen we used to end up what a job what a job you've got great it's a great he's a great guy too lisa su of amd lisa lisa thank you congratulations great job jam sanicar of palantir by a lot of things from palantir where are you are we paying our bills i think so we just made a deal with the european union where they're going to pay the united states of america 100 percent of the cost of all military equipment they're going to ship it to the european union and then they'll distribute it and much of will go to ukraine but a long time since you've heard those words we're in for 350 billion dollars but now we send it to europe and europe pays and they were they were great we had a tremendous nano meeting a few weeks ago and it was pretty amazing actually what happened they agreed to go from two percent to five percent and they had two percent where they didn't pay they have five percent where they've already paid that's a big difference that's a trillions of dollars actually trillions but they're going to spend that money in the united states with our defense companies and we're going to send it to them and they'll distribute the equipment that we send so that's the way it should have been three years ago frankly and jeff sprecher the other half of that incredible family is he here is he here he's a fantastic guy international intercontinental exchange and he's been a friend of mine for a long time the husband of galle who's really doing a good job you are really doing a good job and small business which is actually big business if you add it all up right probably the biggest bank there is and but they call it small business and she's done a fantastic job thanks go say hello to jeff as we gathered this afternoon we're still in the earliest days of one of the most important technological revolutions in the history of the world around the globe everyone is talking about artificial intelligence i find that too artificial i get i can't stand it i don't even like the name you know i don't like anything that's artificial so could we straighten that out please we should change the name i actually mean that i don't like the name artificial anything because it's not artificial it's genius it's pure genius and it's potential to transform every type of human endeavor and domain of human knowledge from medicine to manufacturing to warfare and national defense whether we like it or not we're suddenly engaged in a fast-paced competition to build and define this groundbreaking technology that will determine so much about the future of civilization itself because of the genius and creativity of silicon valley and it is incredible incredible genius without question the most brilliant place anywhere on earth america is the country that started the ai race and as president of the united states i'm here today to declare that america is going to win it we're gonna work hard we're going to win it because we will not allow any foreign nation to beat us our children will not live in a planet controlled by the algorithms the adversaries advancing values and interests contrary to our own we don't want to have contrary interests we want to get along and we'll get along with other countries we're having a great relationship as i told you with those countries that we mentioned with japan and indonesian so many others the european union we're getting along we're getting along very well with china a lot of respect for presidency we have a great relationship and we'll see how it all works out but we're getting along with countries very it's really been pretty amazing i will say that and it's a good thing it's a good thing not a bad thing so from this day forward it'll be a policy of the united states to do whatever it takes to lead the world in artificial intelligence of such an important thing happening this is really something that nobody expected it just popped out of the popped out of the year and here we are but we will defend our nation our values our future and our freedom and it will be really great but we what we really need to be successful is a very simple phrase called common sense and that begins with a common sense application of artificial and intellectual property rules it's so important you can't be expected to have a successful ai program when every single article book or anything else that you've read or studied you're supposed to pay for gee i read a book i'm supposed to pay somebody and you know we we appreciate that but you just can't do it because it's not doable and if you're going to try and do that you're not going to have a successful program i think most of the people in the room know what i mean when a person reads a book or an article you've gained great knowledge that does not mean that you're violating copyright laws or have to make deals with every content provider and that's a big thing that you're working on right now i know but you just can't do it china is not doing it and if you're going to be beating china and right now we're leading china very substantially in ai very very substantially and nobody's seen the the amount of work that's going to be bursting upon the scene but you have to be able to play by the same set of rules so when you have something when you read something and when it goes into this vast intelligence machine we'll call it you cannot expect to every time every single time say oh let's pay this one that much let's pay this one just doesn't work that way of course you can't copy or plagiarize an article but if you read an article and learn from it we have to allow ai to use that pool of knowledge without going through the complexity of contract negotiations of which there would be thousands for every time we use ai we also have to have a single federal standard not 50 different states regulating this industry of the future and some people would say gee that's an unpopular thing to say i was told before i got up here this is an unpopular thing because some people they don't want that but i want you to be successful and you can't have one state holding you up you can't have three or four states holding you up you can't have a state with standards that is so high that it's going to hold you up you have to have a federal rule and regulation hopefully you have the right guy in this position that's going to that's going to supplant the states if you are operating under 50 different sets of state laws the most restrictive state of all will be the one that rules so you could have a state run by a crazy governor a governor that hates you a governor that's not smart or maybe a governor that's very smart but decides that he doesn't like the industry and he can put you out of business because you're going to have to go to that lowest common denominator we need one common sense federal standard that supersedes all states supersedes everybody so you don't end up in litigation with 43 states at one time you got to go litigation free it's the only way and we also have to watch europe asia and all foreign countries so that they don't make rules and regulations that likewise make it impossible for you to do business and where you'd have to make everything and ai cater to them because again you'd have to cater to the toughest country or to the toughest state you can't do that because it would ruin it i just terminated all of the as an example california car emissions rules which were a disaster a disaster cost them it cost them just billions of dollars as an industry but thousands of dollars per car the emission rule standard because they were making the production of an automobile almost impossible and at a tremendously higher cost much more expensive than it should cost for very little gain for actually in my opinion negative gain the automobile was worse under this administration our innovation will be unmatched and our capabilities will be unrivaled and with the help of many of the people in this room america's ultimate triumph will be absolutely unstoppable we will be unstoppable as a nation again we're way ahead and we want to stay that way we can't let individual smaller units stop it because that's the only thing that can stop it and can really mess it up as with any such breakthrough this technology brings the potential for bad as well as for good for peril as well as for progress but the daunting power of ai is the really it's uh not going to be a reason for retreat from this new frontier on the contrary it is the more reason we must ensure it is pioneered first and best we have to have the best the first pioneer we are the best and the first pioneers and we're going to be really putting a nation that we love america we're going to be putting it first i have an expression america first make america great again a lot of great expressions but they're all so true make america great again we're going to make this industry absolutely the top because right now it's it's a beautiful baby that's born we have to grow that baby and let that baby thrive we can't stop it we can't stop it with politics we can't stop it with foolish rules and even stupid rules at the same time we want to have rules but they have to be smart they have to be brilliant they have to be more brilliant than even the technology itself surely there will be challenges on the path ahead but together we will meet them and transcend them all we are americans and we are americans first a couple of people i know that it don't happen to be from here but i wish you a lot of luck anyway i'm looking at three people i'm not americans but very good people please please treat them nicely but we do not shrink from the future a coward the face of uncertainty we dominate the future we conquer new frontiers and we control our own fate and we determined by doing that our own destiny winning this competition will be a test of our capacities unlike anything since the dawn of the space age you believe that it's hard to believe as a as the president the amount of enthusiasm for this one industry i mean i can talk about cars where we're doing incredibly well we have car companies moving in all the time but i talk about other industries is everybody's saying this is going to dominate the world they're going to dominate every industry that ever conceived i don't know if that's true i don't know if it's true but i can tell you that a lot of very brilliant people think it is true it'll dominate everything it will challenge us to marshal all of our strength and flex the muscles of american ingenuity and resolve like probably never before it will require us to blast through obsolete systems cut through thickets of regulation we've got to get rid of some of the regulation but we want good regulation and we build the industrial bedrock of our country and perhaps most importantly winning the ai race will demand a new spirit of patriotism and national loyalty in silicon valley and long beyond silicon valley for too long much of our tech industry pursued a radical globalism that left millions of americans feeling distrustful and betrayed and you know that everybody knows that everybody in this room certainly does many of our largest tech companies have reaped the blessings of america freedom while building their factories in china hiring workers in india and slashing profits in ireland you know that all the wild is missing and even censoring their fellow citizens right here at home under president trump those days are over we need us technology companies to be all in for america we want you to put america first you have to do that that's all we ask that's all we ask to partner with our tech geniuses and achieve in this vision today we're releasing the white house ai action plan big stuff signing it right after this in fact i see it sitting right there maybe i should just sign it right now who the hell has to make the rest of this speech right but here are the pillars of the strategy first my administration will use every tool at our disposal to ensure that the united states can build and maintain the largest most powerful and most advanced ai infrastructure anywhere on the planet america needs new data centers new semiconductor and chip manufacturing facilities new power plants and transmission lines and under my leadership we're going to get that job done and it's going to be done with certainty and environmental protection and all of the things that we have to do to get it done properly virtually all of these large capital investments can be and should be made by the private sector and they want to do that they just want to be able to do it but for that reason america must once again be a country where innovators are rewarded with a green light not strangled with red tape so they can't move so they can't breathe and that's not going to happen you're going to see things that you've never seen in this country before so often and i've been watching for many years i've watched regulation i've been a victim of regulation the zone change that takes six years for a building in manhattan or whatever but i was good at zone changes but it took a long time by the time you got the zoning the market changed you didn't want to build the building you say well but in some cases that made you lucky didn't it huh and some could not too many people understand that in this room but in some cases waiting for that approval as the market collapsed was a good thing not a bad thing but it's time to reclaim our heritage as a nation of builders and that's why upon taking office i signed a historic executive order directing that every one and this is so important for every new regulation 10 old regulations must be immediately eliminated so we have old regulations but clog up the books that don't even mean anything anymore you know in my first term i had more regulation cuts than any president in history times four and that included two term presidents where you're talking about eight years we had more than any other president and i think we may even top it this year we may very well be able to during this period of time because you're really you are a regulation prone group and we're looking to get those regulations out of your way so you can use your genius earlier this month we also enacted the largest tax cuts in american history when i signed the one big beautiful bill into law and i i think the most important thing in the whole tax cut in terms of pure economics and i think one of the reasons that my first you know we had the most successful economy in history during my first term and i think this is going to blow it away so far it is and i think this is going to blow it away but the reason we had was i had expensing at 100 percent and what we did is we included 100 percent in this bill expensing for all capital expenditures including investments in factories and equipment and structure structure wasn't included last time so even structure and you're able to write it all off immediately that's the biggest thing not 38 years not 42 years you're able to write it all off immediately and this time we've made it for 10 years not for one year we've made it for 10 years so you have a much longer period but i'd say get out and take advantage of it i think that's one of the reasons that we had such an incredible uh success with the first tax cuts and one of the things that this bill does is it extends the first tax cuts and uh makes them permanent and in addition to that we were granted other taxes like no tax on tips no tax on social security no tax on overtime a lot of great things one of the things that i mentioned not so pertinent here but if you're in the automobile business it's pertinent i said why is it that people like us always are looking for expenses and deductions and people that buy automobiles that really have to go out and borrow money to buy a car why aren't they allowed to deduct the interest on their loan to buy a car from their income tax and we got it approved we got it approved and that is such a big thing and i think that's going to be such a big thing for the automobile industry we're going to be making more cars within a few years we're going to be making more cars that we made in the very beginning in the super prime you know we lost almost 50% of our automobile business to mexico canada and various other places as you know in europe and in asia and now we're getting it back we're getting it back in record numbers and i think we're going to be topping any amount in a few years we'll be making more automobiles than we've ever made in the history of our country including what i call prime time my administration is also pursuing a future of all-out american energy dominance and on day one i terminated the green new scam you know what that was you were all victims to it perhaps the second or third greatest scam in the history of our country i would say the first was russia russia russia and we had a couple of others too but the green new scam was one of the greatest it's it's so ridiculous what they've what they've made you do the carbon footprint they talked about the carbon footprint and then obama hops onto a 747 air force one and flies to hawaii to play a round of golf and comes back what about the carbon footprint now we didn't we didn't like that and what biden has done is is absolutely terrible he made it impossible almost impossible for people to do business not even talking about the border with millions and millions of people float into our country many from prisons from jails from gangs from mental institutions all over the world no we're not doing that we have to get them out got 11,888 murderers many of them committed more than one murder many of them more than 50 committed more murders we're getting them out of our country or in some cases they're so bad we're not getting them out we're having to lock them up because we don't want them ever to come back no matter how good we're doing you know last month you probably read we had zero people enter our country illegally and over the last number of years you'd have hundreds of thousands literally hundreds of thousands of people a week pour into our country totally unvetted and unchecked and what the hell were they thinking what they've done to our country is so sad and we can never forget it but we're unleashing all forms of energy including natural gas oil and clean beautiful call I instructed my people in the form of chris and dud in particular you are not allowed to say the word call without saying clean beautiful in front of it you can only say clean beautiful call it's a little embarrassing because we had somebody making a speech the other day right and he mentioned the word call about 30 times because that was the subject and he kept going clean beautiful I wanted to say okay just take it easy you could just got a little bit crazy right duck but it's you know china is using it they're building now 57 big power plants all fueled by coal and we have to compete we have to win and we're going to have clean beautiful coal but we have more coal than any we have more anything in terms of energy than anybody oil and gas we also have more coal in May I also signed an executive order to rapidly begin construction of safe reliable nuclear reactors that's a big thing now and many of you will many of you are going to be using nuclear you know I had problems with nuclear I saw some of the things but what they've done with nuclear is like what you've done with AI and other things it's incredible actually it's long-term it's inexpensive it's it's just it's safe what they've done is really amazing so we opened up the industry very strict rules but we opened up the industry and some of you are going to choose nuclear over oil and gas or whatever it might be under the last year of biden china added 11 times as much power generation capacity as did the united states can you imagine that 11 times under the trump administration we will be saying those very famous campaign words drill baby drill and build baby build and we will be adding at least as much electric capacity as china we think we're going to catch them and maybe even have something a little bit extra they're going very rapidly but so are we and we'll be doing at least as much and every company will be given the right to build their own power plant so when you build you can build your power plant with it and you are essentially going to become your own utility it's a utility to yourselves and as I said any excess energy you're going to sell back to the grid and make plenty of money doing it as a result of these pro-american policies since my election we're seeing trillions and trillions of dollars in new investments so at this moment we have almost 17 trillion dollars coming into this country there's never been a period of time like that and that's in a period of a few months in a few months met a amazon google microsoft are all investing 320 billion dollars or more in data centers and ai infrastructure this year those companies are really uh they're really going at it and they're it's very smart people very good people i got to know a lot of them you know i didn't like them so much the first term when i was running i wouldn't say i was thrilled with them but i've gotten to know them and like them and i think they got to like me but i think they got to like my policies maybe much more than me nvidia has committed 500 billion dollars over the next four years thank you jensen i'm sure that'll be a good if you're doing it it's good thank you very much it's a great it's a great statement last week i was in pennsylvania's 20 companies announced 92 billion dollars with david mccormick senator great guy from pennsylvania 92 billion dollars in energy and data center projects including what will soon be the largest natural gas power plant anywhere in north america and they're going to town it's already under construction the largest in north america by far for decades we had leaders who spent their time focused on building up foreign nations under the trump administration we are going to have leaders who are going to build up our nation this colossal investment in ai infrastructure and many other industries for that matter such as automobiles and so many other things will also create thousands and thousands of great paying jobs the kind of jobs we want including lots of blue collar jobs and you know our numbers are very good right now but when you see these numbers in two years from now it will mean higher wages and more opportunity for millions of energy workers hvac technicians engineers electricians and the hardworking citizens who make our country run these are great people that make our country actually run to ensure america maintains the world-class infrastructure we need to win today i will sign a sweeping executive order to fast-track federal permitting streamline reviews and do everything possible to expedite construction of all major ai infrastructure projects and this will be done you will get so good of service in so many ways not only from lee with the environment but you need many other types of permits and you're going to go so fast you're going to say well wait a minute this is too fast i didn't expect to go this quickly this is a problem i may cause a problem in opposite but including factories data centers and power plants of all kinds the united states will have total industry on technological supremacy the second pillar of our action plan for ai dominance is to get the entire world running on the backbone of american technology and i think that's very much happening right now and i think it's going to happen the last administration was obsessed with imposing restrictions on ai including extreme restrictions on its exports as you know they made it very difficult to export this alienated american partners and drove even our friends into the arms of china and other countries that's why upon taking office i repealed the so-called biden diffusion rule can you imagine that that crippled american ai exports the biden diffusion rule i wonder who came up with that name because he does has no idea what it is he had no idea what it was he came up with a rule i wonder who drew that one i wonder was that signed by the autopan i think because they went to him and said we're going to do a diffusion rule mr president what what it's okay the autopan will take care of it it's one of the greatest scandals in the history of our country let me tell you under my administration we will maintain necessary protections for our national security but we will never forget that the greatest threat of all is to forfeit the race and force our partners into rival technology we're not going to do that we're not going to do that i'm going to let that happen that could be the end when i travel to the middle east in may every leader i met was thrilled to do business with american tech firms and with america and they were all thrilled to meet me believe it or not i thought to believe this but they were by the way the most powerful woman in the world is here today susie will stand up please susie will chief is that she can take out a country with a mere phone call no they just voted in the most powerful woman anywhere in the world she might be the most powerful person in the world i think but she's done a fantastic hasn't she done a good job though huh good but uh we're going to come home with trillions and trillions of dollars in deals and that's the way it is but the king of sot arabia met three great leaders i went to three countries predominantly king of sot arabia said and i can say that qatar and ua e the leaders brilliant guys great people they said the same thing they said you know what that one year ago your country was dead it was a dead country they were looking at china they were looking at other places but you had a dead country and today mr president you have the hottest country anywhere in the world they said that and they meant it so strongly and when i went to nato two weeks ago well we made the deal where they pay five percent instead of two percent they uh said the same exact thing they said boy tell you what a difference it is it's a year ago you people were dead we didn't think you were going to make it as a country today you're the hottest country of the world they all said it all those leaders said 30 of them so today i'm signing another major executive order that will turn america into an ai export powerhouse under this order secretary luttnick and secretary marco rubio marco rubio is doing a great job as secretary of state will work to rapidly expand american ai exports of all kinds from chips to software to data storage of all kinds and that's very important that's going to give you the freedom to do what you want to do and third once and for all we are getting rid of woke is that okay because i know you had a higher under you had a higher all woke people i heard you had a higher all woke people under some of these things how about the chips where they give you the chip the chip nonsense where they give you billions of dollars if you only build a chip company these people have plenty of money they don't need the money they need the permits they need the rights to do it they need they don't want to pay tariffs so they come and they build here that's why they're coming here they like number one they like me but they like but they like not having to pay tariffs even more and they're coming but biden gave billions of dollars to companies that have nothing but cash and they don't say where to build let's just give them money but here's the problem they have to hire lots of woke people and they say woke isn't for this particular industry we've noticed that they're not for a lot of industries if you want to know the truth so the guidelines were impossible they're going to give you money but you got to hire this and this and this and that and i don't want to get into it too much because i don't want any controversy today but you have to hire a lot of people that were not into this particular world that you're in and so therefore all the money they gave didn't mean a damn thing one of biden's worst executive orders established toxic diversity equity and inclusion ideology as a guiding principle of american ai development so you immediately knew that was the end of your development but the american people do not want woke marxist lunacy in the ai models and neither do other countries they don't want it they don't want anything to do with it that's why on day one i very proudly terminated joe biden's order on woke ai effective immediately you don't have any of those crazy rules crazy rule and in just a moment i will be signing an order banning the federal government for procuring ai technology that has been infused with partisan bias or ideological agendas such as critical race theory which is ridiculous and from now on the u.s government will deal only with ai that pursues truth fairness and strict impartiality we're not going to go through the craziness that we've gone through for the last four years and then we skip four and then you go back and it started then but it hung around a little while now it's not hanging around there all now it's actually very uncool as somebody told me the other day it's so uncool to be woke i encourage all american companies to join us in rejecting poisonous marxism in our technology it'll be very interesting to see what's happening in new york because they're actually thinking about electing a communist in new york they like to call him a socialist he's not a socialist he's a communist but don't worry you're going to be okay so has to get his money from the white house and that's not going to happen until he shapes up but as an example we are not going to allow men to play in women's sports that's an example that's one and they say that's that's an 80-20 number they say 80% would be against it no it's not 80-20 it's about 97-3 and i don't know who the three are i've never seen anybody i've never had a person i've seen everybody i'm a very open person they come up to me and they talk to me i've never had anybody come up sir you have to let men play in women's sports i've never had it i deal with hundreds of thousands of people every time i talk to somebody nobody's ever they talk about ai they talk about everything but they've never said you've got to allow this is ridiculous men should be allowed to play in women's sports it's uh it's sort of crazy isn't it huh you have to see did you see the race it was a race a long distance marathon one of those all day deals and we had one of the great female runners and we had one of the great male runners and at the end of the day he won the race by five hours and 14 seconds they waited around for the really good athlete female it's very demeaning to women i want to tell you that but they waited her parents were waiting for hours somebody said why don't you go back to the hotel and sleep for a few hours and come back and meet your daughter this is what they do you got to see the weightlifting records are they the best of all a woman lifted two hundred and twelve pounds it was a world record it held for 18 years and now a man who transitioned came up and looked at the bar how much is it two hundred and twelve pounds oh let me try it i think he broke the record by 109 pounds it's going to be a long time it's going to be a long time before a woman catches that and these are great athletes and great people and it's demeaning and who the hell wants this we were off of that whole standard because i just tell you those as examples were off of it the reason the last administration was so eager to regulate and restrict ai was so they could limit this technology to just a few large companies allowing them to centralize it censor it control it weaponize it and they would weaponize a very dishonest group of people you probably saw that because we caught him in the act we really caught him we had it before but now we really have him we have it we're a counselor this is the exact opposite of my approach the unique strength of the american tech industry has always come from its startups and small tech it comes through small jensen was small we have a small i think so when you started in your bedroom i think you were small right he started as very small and now he's really become very amazing if you regulate them too much you kill the source of american genius and technological power i believe that jill biden had a plan to lose the ai race i think he wanted to lose it because his plan would never have worked it would have never been successful and you would have spent a lot of money and you wouldn't have been able to win they didn't allow you to win but we have a plan which only admires and respects the winners every citizen should take incredible pride in the inspiring feats of american innovators who are pushing the bounds of human knowledge and achievement the people of open ai google meta and countless startups are proving once again that america is impossible you are just impossible to beat you're not going to be beaten we're not going to let that happen when you do your best when you work your hardest and when you're allowed to be free of horrible foolish regulation and you can have regulation but it's going to be sensible smart regulation there's nobody who's going to beat you as we push even further into this exciting frontier let us never forget that all of this prosperity and progress has come from the culture of freedom and hard work married ambition and risk taking passed down from one generation of americans to the next silicon valley rose to wealth fame and glory by exemplifying these values and it will win this race not by rejecting them but by embracing them like they have never been embraced before we must put america first this is a nation that invented the light bulb the telegraph the television the telephone the computer chip the smartphone the gps the integrated circuit and even the internet basically we invented everything what is left we invented everything and now it's ai we invented everything does anyone have anything else to say and now we're going to take it to a new level but americans were the first to fly a plane first to harness the atom and first to plant our flag on the moon we mastered the industrial age we created the digital age and now we are leading the world into the golden age indeed the golden age of america with your help that golden age will be built by american workers it will be powered by american energy it will be run on american technology improved by american artificial intelligence and it will make america richer stronger greater freer and more powerful than ever before and i will now do my share by going and signing a name without an auto pen i will sign it if we had one i wouldn't use it anyway but we will sign it auto pen free and we will say donald j trump god bless america and god bless you and good luck because the race has just begun and you're going to win it thank you very much everybody mr president the first day the first executive order that we prepared for your signature today relates to federal permitting for data center infrastructure as you mentioned during your speech this is a crucial issue affecting the entire ai industry what this executive order will do is establish fast track permitting and ensure that the federal government is working to get data centers approved and through the permitting pipeline as quickly as possible as you said before sir it's absolutely essential that american ai models and american the american ai industry dominates the future of this industry around the world what this next executive order will do is is promote through various instrumentalities of the federal government the export abroad of american ai models to ensure american ai dominance in the future okay and lastly sir as you said in your speech we don't want woke ai we want ai models based on accurate information that give accurate information and accurate answers this executive order will ensure that when the federal government procures or promotes different ai models uh that those ai models are ideologically neutral that they don't embrace wokeism and critical race theory and all of these terrible theories that have done so much damage to our country thank you very much everybody good luck good president trump speaking extensively at winning the ai race that summit not far

hillary clinton communist john brennan james comey the person who said 86 47 in seashells and then posted about it very strange for a former fbi director to do that but president trump focusing in on the successes not only of this administration what happened last week with 92 billion dollars of investments from 20 companies in the commonwealth of pennsylvania during the ai and energy summit hosted by senator dav mccormick also the authorization of building more nuclear plants energy and ai going hand in hand in this country and now three executive orders dealing with data centers and
