{"text": " Welcome back, and we do have President Trump there in Scotland. Let's lift up the audio Nothing we just I think it's more of a celebration than a workout. It's a great deal for both and We're gonna have a meeting on other things other than the deal the deal is concluded Well, that's what he does. I mean, you know, he that's fine if he does that that's up to him It's not up to me. I'm with the United States. I'm not with France I think it's terrible what happened with Hamas they tapped everybody along and we'll see what happens we'll see what Response Israel has to that, but it's getting to be that time You said there's a 50-50 chance of a deal. What is left to work out? What are the final sticking points? I don't know with the European Union, I think we have a good 50-50 chance That's a lot. What are the sticking points? Well, I don't want to tell you what the sticking points are But the sticking points are having to do with maybe 20 different things. You don't want to listen to all of them Yes Very Well, it is but I like your Prime Minister He's slightly more liberal than I am as you've probably heard, but he's a good man. He got a trade deal done And you know, they've been working on this deal for 12 years. He got it done. It's a good deal It's a good deal for the UK. So no, I'll be seeing him tomorrow. I guess tomorrow evening and This is our wonderful ambassadors, you know, he's doing a good job He'll be he's a very very successful man. He'll be doing a good job The best course the best course anywhere in the world is Turnberry the players all want to be a Turnberry Everybody wants to be a turnburst. So we'll see how that works out. Oh I think the well the infrastructure in the course is good in fact the Royal and ancient I don't know You're aware of this. They spent a lot of money hundreds of thousands of dollars or Probably into the millions of dollars and they've laid all the wire for television and for electricity Under the holes of Turnberry So that when the open gets there they have it all done they paid for that I don't know what you can do all I can tell you is that it would be the best place anywhere in Your country to have There's no place like it. There's no place like Turnberry It's the best probably the best course in the world and I would say Aberdeen is right up there Also Aberdeen is great and while we're here I'll be with my son and he's gonna cut a ribbon for the second course at Aberdeen Which is just about equal to the first. I mean, it's gonna be a battle to fill You know, it's as you know, they're very highly rated and the second course is great Sean Connery have helped get me the permits If it weren't for Sean Connery, we wouldn't have those great courses No, I was never never I really have no Really nothing to say about it. She is Being talked to by a very smart man by a very good man Todd Blanche and I don't know anything about the conversation. I haven't really been following it a Lot of people are asking me about partons. Obviously. This is no time to be talking about partons But a lot of people have asked about parton This is just not a time to be talking about partons Todd will Come back with whatever he's got and you make it a very big thing over something. That's not a big thing You should be talking about if you're gonna talk about that talk about Clinton Talk about the former president of Harvard talk about all of his friends talk about the hedge fund guys That will with them all the time. Don't talk about Trump What you should be talking about is the fact that we have the greatest six months in the history of a presidency according to a lot of people and We had an amazing six months and this is sort of an example of it now. We're meeting with the European Union having We're also meeting with as you know the head of UK Prime Minister and I look forward to that but we're meeting in terms of a deal we're meeting with the European Union and That would be actually the biggest deal of the ball if we make Did you ask House Republican leaders to not vote on the resolution about I was never I was never involved in that Focus on making deals. I'm not focused on Conspiracy theories that you are I mean I watch you people. It's it's so sad You're to talk about the success of our country instead of this nonsense you to talk about over and over again Well, I say think I say two things to Europe stop the windmills. You're ruining your countries I really mean it. It's so sad you fly over and you see these windmills all over the place ruining your beautiful fields and valleys and Killing your birds and if they're stuck in the ocean ruining your oceans Stop the windmills and I also I mean there's a couple of things I could say but on immigration You better get your act together You're not going to have Europe anymore You got to get your act together and we you know as you know last month we had nobody entering our country Nobody shut it down and we took out a lot of bad people that got there with Biden Biden was a total stiff And what he allowed to happen, but you're allowing it to happen to your countries and you got to stop the this horrible Invasion that's happening to Europe many countries in Europe some people some Leaders have not let it happen and They're not getting the proper credit they should I could name them to you right now, but I'm not going to embarrass the other ones but stop This immigration is killing Europe and the other thing stop the windmills killing the beauty of your countries Thank you very much everybody All right, there you have it President Donald Trump arriving in Scotland for that trip that will last for several days One thing you heard him say is that he does plan to meet with the head of the European Union coming up in just a couple days I believe that will be on Sunday now It's not clear if we're gonna get news conferences or things of that nature But we'll make sure to bring any comments here over the next several days from President Trump to you as we always do in full and commercial free", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 5.3, "text": " Welcome back, and we do have President Trump there in Scotland.
