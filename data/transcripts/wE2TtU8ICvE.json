{"text": " President Trump now addressing House Republicans at the White House. He just walked in. Let's listen live The speaker would call and it's a please please get him to vote I said it's four in the morning and everybody took the call and just about everybody voted and it's an amazing thing So amazing that I just signed and it was really helped a lot by our big beautiful Deal that we just did the big beautiful bill as we call it But I just signed the largest trade deal in history. I think maybe the largest deal in history with Japan And that was done with Japan they had their top people here and We worked on it long and hard and it's a great deal for everybody. I always say it has to be great for everybody It's a great deal a lot different from the deals in the past. I can tell you that But we're doing really well as a country. We're strong We have a lot of money flowing in the tariffs are kicked in better than anybody Other than me and a few of the people in the room Thought could happen Howard and Scott and I just want to thank you. You've been unbelievable Allies because you're really allies. That's what you've been and we appreciate it. Some you some were very difficult but you got there and Some were a little bit they had a little confidence and they they came in earlier. We appreciate we just appreciate everybody But we gather tonight to celebrate six months of incredible achievements by one of the most successful house majorities in American history Despite having an incredibly Narrow margin and you know that we had a little bit we had actually one Period speaker where we had one in other words We had a majority of one then we took a few good victories with some little elections that took place a couple of other things happen And we ended up with seven but we had one and the speaker said to me, you know, we're one heart attack away from losing the majority We don't want to be there and I think the results of what we're doing together will give us a tremendous midterm We're gonna work together very hard. We're gonna make all those robo calls for you and we're gonna we're gonna pick it up And we're gonna really we're gonna increase. I think we should increase by a lot But despite this incredibly narrow margin that you've already fulfilled think of this more promises than any Congress in Generations has been no Congress and we've had some even where we were up quite a bit But there's been no Congress like this Congress in terms of achievement that people can even think of now We have to take world wars out. We can take a couple of things out But basically there's been there's never been anything like this and we did this with very small majorities I don't want to thank John Thune also because the Senate has been and all of the people in the Senate because they've been terrific Also working with Mike and everybody But I especially tonight want to thank Speaker Johnson for doing a job that I think I Think you'll go down and I think he's got a long way to go He's gonna go down as one of the greatest speakers at any time in history And you know and I say this you needed a very precise Personality to get these voters if you had somebody that was just a little bit off you're gonna lose 20 votes Then you couldn't lose any so I just want to thank you everybody believes that too Mike. Thank you very much And Kelly is here hi Kelly hi Kelly Also a man of great courage Steve Scalise he's our majority leader No, I have told the story so many times, but he was he was very brave I saw him and the worst of times I was there at his hospital late at night with his incredible wife and We thought Steve was not with us. He was gonna be He was gonna be a goner and he was tough And I actually think you look better now than you did that if you want to you look better now than you did before this Horrible thing happened. So whatever the hell you're doing. You're gonna have to let us know But he's great And another guy who I've really gotten a like and usually this doesn't happen because I used to have a little argue and say Well, he's a tough guy. He's a nasty tough guy And then I realized how talented he was how good he was and we got to be I think really good friends Tom emmer. He's incredible But His wife are there she is but but she liked me and she said, you know, you you don't understand my husband He's really and she turned out to be right his greatest asset. Thank you both for that soda This is incredible and every other member of Congress that's with us We have almost pretty much a full contingent some of you have your spouses and we Appreciate and that's why we appreciate what you've had to go through these were late nights and a lot of them too We had a lot of them we had if we turned off the phones at 3 30 in the morning. We weren't working very hard It was it was really something so I just want to thank you all and We also have secretary Scott Besant. We just he's over Scott here someplace. I think so Scott. Thank you very much Scott We just see we just came in from the Oval Office where a few people got to watch the negotiation with Japan was interesting Doug Burgum, I think might be here someplace Doug And I said to the Japanese Trade representatives and these were the top people We concluded the one-deal Doug and now we're going to conclude another one because they're forming a joint venture with us at In Alaska as you know for the LNG so I said we'll all do that together with Chris. Is Chris here? I don't know Chris, right? If you could set that up Doug, it would be great, but they're all set to make that deal now So I think it's good. This was really the one they had to make and We're gonna make a deal with Japan on the LNG in Alaska, right? Okay. Thank you very much and Howard Lutnick Who was terrific? He'll never go back into private industry again because he's seen numbers that are so big this deal is they say the biggest deal ever made biggest deal ever made and We have Europe coming in tomorrow and the next day. We have some other ones coming in We're doing things that have never been done in this country before and our country is becoming very rich again And that's the way it should be they're not taking advantage of us and it's very good But Howard will never go back into private, you know, he had a big company But the biggest deal you've ever made is like a quarter of a line of the deal we just left, right? So it's a little tough Scott Turner is here. It's terrific Scott. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you Scott. Good job Good job Scott, thank you very much. In fact Scott come here. Come here. I want to just I'm gonna have Scott Say grace give a little prayer. Yes, I Hope the television stays on, you know, they have a tendency to turn off, but I think that's good What do you think Brian?

Amen That's beautiful, thank you Scott. That's beautiful. Thank you very much so nice So we also want to thank Linda McMahon who's right now. Where are you Linda? She's out negotiating with a lot of different people What a what a great cabinet member in person and she's working on bringing education back to the states where it belongs and Lots of other things like how come Harvard got five billion dollars in the last year and a half or two years five billion They got Linda said, you know, they're not going to be happy what? Harvard's getting billions and billions of dollars and they're not spending it nicely and they're very discriminatory and lots of other things and She's got a tough judge. She's got a judge that Would typically not be with us But I don't want to say that because you never know what happens But we'll win that case ultimately. We're gonna win it no decision made yet But she's in the middle of a lot of things but Linda you have been unbelievable. Thank you very much great job. You've done And I said hello to Chris right Chris is the most talented person Doug actually said that I offered Doug Department of Energy knowledge. He said I have somebody better. He's never said that in his whole life about anybody Mary He's never said that about anybody but he said Chris Wright is so incredible and he has certain He's the number one guy in the oil industry and he left for I won't even tell you the money He was making it was crazy money But he knew that and he wanted this and he's he and Doug have done an incredible job and thank you Chris very much And Doug Collins, where's Doug Collins Doug Collins, what a great guy he's been what a great guy At the VA right now you have a 92% approval rating that's not bad Let's see if you can get it up a little bit who are the 8% right? But he's working on it. He is working on it. He's a incredible. What a job. Thank you Doug. What a great job You do appreciate it as well as EPA administrator Lee Zeldin. Where's Lee? People don't know he was he was a great lawyer like top of the line and then he became a congressman in a race that he had no chance to win he won and was a congressman like for six years or something and Was highly respected and then he took a shot at running for governor of New York Even though people said it was almost impossible to even think about and he almost won he came so close almost one and I pointed him as the Environmental judge he's our environment czar and what a job secretary on the cabinet He's got everything and the job. He's been doing is incredible because we have 16 trillion dollars so far invested in our country We've never had anything even close and this is just really in the last four months not six months That's what at all. That's when we started Accepting things and getting things going and getting them rock and rolling and Lee is getting the permits for people so fast You know the biggest problem they had is we can't build if you're not gonna give us the permits Or if it's gonna take nine years to get a permit and they get rejected You know, they'd wait nine ten twelve years to do environmental impact statements and at the end of 12 years They'd get a rejection three to two. You know, they gave their lives to it. We don't do that anymore He's he does it within weeks and we really appreciate Lee's got an incredible staff or we appreciate the job He's done. He's an unbelievable guy OMB director Russ fought there's nobody knows the finances of this country and The waste brought an abuse better than Russell so Russell, I want to thank you for doing such a great job You're really in there fighting and really was a big help during this whole Situation that we had Tom right with Russ when we had to know the numbers. There's nobody that knows him better. He lives with him Director of National Intelligence. Oh, where's Tulsi? She's like hotter than everybody She's the hottest one in the room right now Because she found out We're certainly we I think we knew it before at all fairness Tulsi, but now you have certainty She has all the documents. She has everything that you need and she found out that Barack Hussein Obama led a group of people and they cheated in the elections and they cheated without question it's not even a quote would you say there's even a little question there Tulsi she says no and You found things that nobody thought would ever find and Very happy and very honored to have you with us. She's right now by far speaker. She's hotter than you right now speaker She's the hottest person in the room right now speaker. So Tulsi great job, and I know you have a lot more coming. She told me You've seen nothing yet So I heard those rumors about you, but now I know they're true. So we're very proud of you Tulsi. They cheated so badly and ultimately it led to loss in 2020 and it shouldn't have been a loss. It was a big victory. We won by a lot We had to do it again, but if I thought we lost I would never have run again And this is a far more consequential election than it would have been if we did that's the only thing I can say But we can't we can't ever let that happen again to our country Look at what happened in terms of inflation in terms of so many things But most importantly maybe in terms of allowing millions and millions of people into our country that we shouldn't have we shouldn't have these people in our country and their levels of Violence and things that we're seeing are so bad and we're getting them out and Tom Holman and Christie have done an incredible job and but we're getting them out but This should have never happened. It was like just a terrible unforced error. The only thing that I can't figure out I always like to figure the other side. Why would they do this? Why would they allow? people to come into our country from all over the world not just South America but from Venezuela but from all over the World they came and they came by hundreds of thousands in some cases hundreds of thousands a day When you look at some of these they break down gates. We built hundreds of miles of wall They didn't break down the wall, but anything there wasn't a wall. They were able to break it down and they came in though by the millions and We're gonna be paying a price for this that we are paying a price. It's almost it's all consuming and we have to get 11,888 murderers many of them murdered more than one person and They're in here and some are already gone. We've gotten them out some we don't we can't get out We want to put them in jails because we're afraid they'll come back. They're so violent and they used to say no, no these are The illegal immigrants they said are very kind people remember that they used to say they kind they don't commit crimes No, they make our criminals look like extremely nice people and We have to get them out and it's a big job But we're doing it and step by step and last month as you know in June. We had zero People come through the border Zero people No, we're doing a real job, but What we found out is so terrible that Obama and a group of thugs Cheated on the elections. They cheated violently viciously on the elections. They're violent people. They're vicious horrible these are vicious horrible people and We can't let this happen SBA administrator Kelly Loeffler a cabinet member and a great person I Kelly She has done a job, you know, I always say small business. I used to say it with Somebody else that happened to be Linda you happen to be there I said it's small business, but it's actually the biggest business there is right probably there is When you add it up all those little small loans you add them up It's the biggest bank there is but Kelly you're doing a fantastic job. Thank you very much Don't do a better job than Linda that would be terrible Linda had the job before you she was so great, but Don't beat her because Linda would be very upset about that actually she'd be happy I think you'd be happy about it right Linda. That's the way Linda is I want to also express our gratitude to all of the Just a wonderful friends and mostly spouses, but the wonderful friends that we have here This is sort of just a great period of time for the country and it's a great period of time for the Republican Party I also want to wish Congresswoman a truly beautiful woman Mary Miller and her husband her handsome husband It's just like a I'd like to use them on the front page of an advertisement for people that come to a Hotel or something, but they're like a perfect. I think they're a perfect couple Mary Miller, I'd like to thank you and wish you a lot with your husband Chris and a very happy 45th wedding anniversary Wow It's a beautiful couple with beautiful children and grandchildren Keep it going keep it going. Mary's very respected to Chris. You know that she's doing she's doing a fantastic job beautiful woman and happy birthday to Representative Robert at her halt. Where's Robert? Robert Happy anniversary, happy anniversary Robert happy birthday Happy birthday, so we have an anniversary. We have a birthday today anybody else having a birthday or anything Robert great job. You're doing. Thank you very much. We appreciate it very much Time and time again the House Republican majority has defied the odds to deliver win after win for the American people They were giving us very small odds of doing this bill In fact, we were originally breaking it up into seven and then six and then about three and two and Then ultimately we said one and I had it a little different name I had one great big beautiful bill, but Steve said that's too much. That's a little too much Let's take the word great out, but it is great It was a little tougher to say a little too long But we took the word great out, but it's it is one really one incredible situation that we pass and People said that we'll do a number of bills and it'll be much easier typically that's the way except The problem was you had somewhere for the good of the country had to do certain things But it wouldn't necessarily mean you were going to get the votes But you needed it for the good of the country But the big beautiful bill the beauty is that it had something in it and a lot for everyone Including the people in this room that had a vote So I just I think it was an incredible Decision that we made pretty early on right we had a lot of people that were skeptical Mike about doing the one They said it's just not possible to get it passed And I think it actually turned out to be the biggest advantage because everybody had something in it no matter who you were You could go back and say look what we got. Oh, well, that's okay So it really it really worked out. Well, you pass the Lakin Riley Act You pass the Holt fentanyl act that's big stuff You know, we are we are tariffing countries that are sending us fentanyl and working with fentanyl and Sadly, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars, but we don't want to take in billions for that We want them to stop and they will with the help of our great first lady. You pass the take it down act That's a big thing and you it was a bipartisan That was very by I think I'll ask her to get involved in more actually It was like a very by a real bipartisan not where you had to be had a lot of Democrats vote for that one That's a beautiful thing the horrible things that take place on the internet And they destroy children and children do bad things to themselves including you know what the word is suicide and It really broke our heart to see it so often so much and take it down We take it off the internet. They do things that are so bad And it was a great thing that you did bipartisan on July 3rd You passed the one big beautiful bill and that's going to go down I think is one of the most monumental achievements ever in Congressional history in one historic package We delivered the largest tax cut in American history the largest spending cut in American history and the largest border security investment in American history and We got no tax on tips. Think of it. No tax on social security. We have no tax on overtime It's just been there's never been anything like it and when you explain it, you know because the Democrats are out there saying Death that's all that they're given a they you know the word manufactured they manufactured the word they use is death That's the only thing they're good at that's the only thing so they have death and When we get out and sell it's the opposite it gives us life. It gives the country life. It gives You could look at Medicaid Medicare social security gives it life. It means it's going to be here They're going to be here. They wouldn't be here. I don't think we'd have a country You want to know that we didn't win this election? I don't think we'd even have a country but we've achieved more in six months than the most administrations have Achieved during their four years or even eight years. We've achieved more in six months than most administrations have achieved whether it's four years or eight years, which is pretty incredible and When I was in Saudi Arabia, we took back 5.1 trillion dollars. We went to Qatar We went to Saudi Arabia and UAE great leaders all three and Great, they were great And they invested what when I say took it back I mean took it back in terms of an investment in the country 5.1 trillion with a T trillion dollars and the king of Saudi Arabia looked at me says, you know what? one year ago America was dead your country was dead. He said and now you have the hottest country anywhere in the world That's a big statement and that was two months ago But he said you went from a dead country, which is pretty hard to hear that but it's true I mean think of it. We had a dead country. We had an embarrassment you all over the world They were laughing at us were like we were a bunch of fools We had a dead country now. We have the hottest country anywhere in the world There's no country even close to being as hot and those great representatives of Japan that a few of you including the speaker got to See in action smart and sharp and they said the same thing They said look you have the hottest country in the world So since I took office the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 and they just did it again today have set more than a dozen record highs Core inflation is way down below 2% Think of that and gas prices are the lowest they've been in many many years. You know, it's interesting I watched the Democrats and they get on these shows. Well prices are up Energy is up Gas elite is through the roof Food and groceries are up. It they lie One guy even said eggs are up and we reduce it by about five times think of it eggs because when I first got here the first week They hit me the fake news back there. They hit me First week they're screaming me eggs are through the roof. What are you gonna? I said, this isn't my problem This was Biden did this not Trump, but they were screaming at me I said just give me a chance and I will say our Secretary of Agriculture Brooke did a great job She's here too. Thank you, bro But think of what we've done so prices are all down I don't think there's any price other than we have a real Terrible terrible head of the Fed and if he brought down interest, you know in in Europe the European Union they've lowered their interest rate now 11 times and we haven't lowered ours at all He's a stiff. He's a knucklehead and I was very nice to him at the beginning because I know how to sell and you know There's certain point it didn't matter anymore because the guy is just Not a smart person shouldn't have been there and I blame myself in a way for that But I blame I blame Biden for extending. I was surprised that they extended him But they did I think they extended him because they knew how much I couldn't stand him So they did it for that reason but and he did lower He did lower the rate before the election two or three times It's the only time he's really acted like that But no, he's a bad job and he's hurting people He's hurting people that can't get houses because they don't have mortgages and I don't know if he knows it or not He's either evil or stupid and either is really not acceptable, but he's he's not doing a good job and But it'll be he's only going to be there for a short while not going to be there much longer I do regulation efforts of saving the typical family thousands and thousands of dollars So remember when you campaigning got to remember this Prices are down groceries are down oil is down energy is down gasoline is why we hit 199 a gallon today in five different states, you know in California In California, he keeps adding taxes, you know when you go to seven eight thousand But I mean they just keep putting taxes on gasoline. It's crazy. I think you ought to take a look at that Doug It's ridiculous what he's doing out there and he's really hurting people a lot, but we have in free market We have gasoline that's getting down to the low twos and in some cases even breaking that I think you're gonna end up breaking it if Doug does his job with Chris You're gonna be so drill baby drill right Doug. That's Doug. He really took that theme to heart These going wild actually and we'll fill up the strategic reserves, you know, they use this the big these are massive Cavities in earth that down that you wouldn't believe how big and they took the oil out that we put in we put in a lot at good Prices and they took it out before the election and it didn't really amount to that much for cars You know, it didn't last that long actually because that's a big as big as those cavities We call them cavities are caves of incredible salt There's salt mines and they have almost an unlimited capacity, but it is limited and they were just about filled up to the top and for the election they They started emptying it wasn't meant for that. It was meant it really meant for a military emergency. It wasn't meant to Keep prices down so that somebody can win an election But obviously that didn't work and the blue collar workers have already seen their largest real wage increase in 60 years Another thing you can say but the biggest thing you can say And I told Mike today. I said Mike. There's one thing where I don't believe we can lose so At the end of my first term I was so proud of myself because I worked very hard and pharmaceuticals drug prices Went down for the first time in 28 years thinking that first time in 28 years. They went down. You know what they went down one quarter of one point Little much the line was almost straight. It was like key But it went down first time in many years 28, I think And I was so proud. I called a news conference to announce that drug prices have gone down for the first time in many years And I thought it was great, but then I did something much better and this is what you have to run on I have a friend who It's a serious weight problem serious He's brilliant, but extremely heavy. I'm being nice And he takes ozampic Or as they call it the fat drug And he's a brilliant guy. He's rich tough highly neurotic He's a mess He's a total mess, but he is brilliant and rich and he uh He was in london And he calls me like president. He always used to call me donny now. He calls me president That's good. I like that better because he has president. What's going on. I just bought The ozampic for 88 dollars And in new york, I pay 1,300 Same factory same Company that makes it same everything 88 dollars to 1,300. Oh, he said almost 1,300 dollars and I explained to him that That's the way it's been for many many years where people actually go to europe in order to buy Drugs when they come back they'll load it up. In fact, sometimes they get arrested for Having so much. They think they're drug addicts. They just buy months of supply because it's sometimes One tenth one eighth one fifth one half It's a tremendous difference And this is for the people in this room because this is something that nobody else can do We're going to get the drug prices down not 30 or 40 percent, which would be great not 50 or 60. No, we're going to get them down 1,000 percent 600 percent 500 percent 1,500 percent Numbers that are not even thought to be achievable because I've Used a certain talent that I have and convinced the drug companies that you have no choice the drug companies were selling drugs same company in europe and other places Based on what europe told them to sell them at And they said let america pick up the difference and I wouldn't let it happen I wouldn't let it happen So I invoked what's called a favored nations provision so that we will pay the same price as the lowest nation anywhere in the world And drugs will come down like from as an example $1,300 in the case I gave you they'll come down from $1,300 now In the world they'll go up a little bit not as much as you think because the world is bigger than the united states in terms of population As you probably know But it will go up And maybe it'll go up instead of 88 or 90 dollars. It will go up to 110 or 120 or 140, but we're going to come down to 140 so you're going to have it coming down from $1,300 to 140 150 160 what difference I mean somewhere big And it'll be you know serious it'll be numbers that nobody can even imagine That's going to have a huge impact on medicaid medicare Even social security. It's going to have a huge impact on everything So I just want you to know that that's one of the things that you have And they'll never be able to take it away from you. You know when I said no tax on tips Kamala Got just killed. We won Nevada by a lot, you know, they have 99.9 of the people working hotels, right? I said no tax on tips and a month later she said And there will be no tax on tips and they got booed out of the room because they knew that was our issue So they'll try and pick up on this issue. They can't because we did it But they'll try anyway because they do lie terribly We will have reduced drug prices by a thousand percent by 1100 1200 1300 1400 700 600 Not 30 or 40 or 50 percent But numbers the likes of which you've never even dreamed of before And we're working very hard right now to get The other countries to lift up their prices a little bit and to get the drug companies to put it to them And if they don't the drug companies will have a lot of problems and they are mostly agreed to it And if the countries don't then as an example of its europe I'll say that's okay. You're no longer allowed to sell cars in america. You're no longer allowed to have Mercedes bmw folks wagon or any of the other Many cars and they will say oh, I love the idea of lower drug prices for america so You have to use that you have to use that because it's I mean, I can't think of anything that can be more powerful than that Okay, and there's nothing more powerful than that And we can't forget about it. I said one thing i'm going to I said to the speaker today I said the one thing i'm going to bring up tonight because we have so many of the Congressional the congressmen and women in the room But the one thing i'm going to bring up is what we did with we call it favored nations But so we're going to have the lowest drug prices anywhere in the world left We'll be tied for the lowest drug price essentially anywhere in the world And you can win your election. I don't care where you come from that helps everybody. There's no other point I think that can what do you think mary? Do you agree? Okay, I agree too mary. You better agree mary if you didn't agree If you didn't agree But no, it's an amazing thing and nobody thought that was even possible We've negotiated historic trade deals with the united kingdom indonesia china today japan and the philippines We just did the philippines today also a good deal. We have stopped wars between india and pakistan the democratic republic of the kongo and rwanda that was going on for 30 years and by the way india pakistan was probably going to end up in a nuclear war They kept you know, they had they shut down five planes in the last attack And it was back and forth back and forth back and forth and I called them and I said listen No more trade if you do this you you're not going to be good But they have both they're both powerful nuclear nations and that would have happened and Who knows where that would have ended up and I stopped it Iran you saw we took out their entire capability of nuclear Kosovo and Serbia we stopped that And a couple of others that we didn't stop a war, but we stopped what probably could have ended up in a war And we do that on the house. It's compliments of america. Okay. Do you think biden would do that? I don't think so. Do you think he ever heard of any of those countries? I don't think so I was sitting there Screaming back and forth with japan And somebody said can you imagine biden doing this? I don't think so. There would be no negotiation We'd just be ripped off like we have been for we've been ripped off so many years by Friend and foe and you know what the friend has been worse in many cases than the foe But ripped off on trade and other things and I'm very proud to tell you that with nato The european if you look the european countries essentially will be buying Our equipment paying a hundred percent on the dollar and then they're going to distribute it to where they're going to distribute it Which is going to be To ukraine or whatever, but they're buying it. So we're not going to have The expense of giving away biden gave away 350 billion dollars worth of equipment or cash worse than equipment cash So we want to find out about that someday. I guess right But uh, they were supposed to buy their own equipment But I you know, I have a feeling they didn't spend every every dollar on the equipment But they are brave look they're fighting a hard fight And we're not long we're no longer going to be do that our Our great companies we make the best military equipment in the world and our great companies are going to be selling now And they'll be using it. So even those people that don't want to be in the war and i'm one of them But even those people are saying wow, that's pretty good. That's pretty good So they'll be able to defend themselves and we will no longer be paying for it And I think that's a very big I think that's a very big thing So we've uh Achieved incredible things in a very short period of time And in polling released just last week it was announced that the approval for congressional democrats under hakeem jeffreys has reached The lowest ever recorded 19 percent And republicans are doing well and I have the best numbers i've ever had you know, it's amazing I watch people on television. Well, what about donald trump's polling numbers? Yeah, they're the best numbers i've ever had and with this Made up hoax that they're talking about my numbers have gone up four and five points It's they want to do anything to get us off the subject of making america great again And we're not going to put up with it And remember don't let them forget it's so important obama Cheated on the election. Look the camera just went off obama the red light just went off. Can you believe these people are bad there? obama Cheated when they give you all nonsense obama cheated and his people cheated but he was there they ever hear this they talk about if if they ever even mention it They never mentioned his name just the opposite with me But they only mentioned my name. They don't mention any of you guys. They don't mention tom. They don't mention steve They don't mention our great speaker. They mentioned trump all the time. I'd like to have a mention you but remember this obama cheated on the election And we have it cold hard blue and it's getting even more so because the stuff that's coming in is not even believable so And and you should mention that every time they give you a question. That's uh, not appropriate Just say oh by the way, obama cheated on the election. You'll you'll watch the camera turn off instantly But I want to thank all of you again once again. This is an incredible job. It's incredible people really incredible people and you know, it's very interesting Um, I got to know so many of you over the last Over the last six months really but so many of you some I didn't know but you have tremendous talent And you have a some I I spoke to too much And I particularly like the ones that didn't have to speak to at all. Mary. I didn't have to call Mary But in particular But now but I like them all look in the end we got there. We got the vote of almost all a couple of people That uh, we'll never vote no matter what, you know, they think it's so cool not to vote They have no suggestions. They have no ideas. They have no nothing. They just want to vote no I don't know why they're not doing very well on the polls right now by the way I'll tell you right now But I wanted just if I could for a second because he really deserves it Is truly a spectacular person spectacular man. I'd like to ask the speaker mike johnson to come up and say if you Mr. President, I'm not going to speak long these guys hear me talk all the time. Okay I just want to say that we have been making history together and we're making history because you are the visionary bold strong leader that america needed the american people recognize that They gave us a mandate and we're delivering on it That the exciting thing about the big beautiful bill is america first is no longer just an agenda It is now the law of the land my friends I Could go by and name person by person and I should name their spouses as well all the members in this room Everybody deserves the credit. They underestimated us all the time all the time every day because our margin is so small But we do not accept that is our fate. We work together This was prayer and patience and preparation and teamwork that got it done They they we began this this about a year and a half before that bill was delivered the deliberate work down on the trenches I could name our the chairman of all of our committees 11 committees of jurisdiction They worked on the big beautiful bill all the members in here who contributed their ideas their thoughts their expertise They gave their heart and soul to it, mr. President because they wanted to deliver for you And deliver for the people and we did it together and I'm telling you this is landmark stuff There's not anything bigger I think we may ever work on ever in this legislative arena because it it may not even be possible But we did it and i'm so grateful and i'm so thankful and humbled to work with this group Mr. President they are committed to the country as you are you are the strong leader the example for us with your stamina We know we can never sleep. Okay We've got much more to do much more to do deliver for the people who are going to do it We thank you for the opportunity. Thank you for the celebration.
